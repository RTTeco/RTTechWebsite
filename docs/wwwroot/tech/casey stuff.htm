<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="5">Casey At The Bat</font><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
</center><font face="Bookman Old Style">The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;<br>
The score stood four to two with but one inning left to play;<br>
And then, when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br>
A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">A straggling few got up to go, in deep despair. The rest<br>
Clung to that hope which &quot;springs eternal in the human breast;&quot;<br>
They thought, If only Casey could but get a whack at that,<br>
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">But Flynn proceed Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br>
And the former was a no-good and the latter was a fake;<br>
So, upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br>
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br>
And Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball,<br>
And when the dust had lifted and men saw what had occurred,<br>
There was Jimmy safe at second, and Flynn a-hugging'' third.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Then from five thousand throats and more their rose a lusty yell,<br>
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell,<br>
It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br>
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br>
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face,<br>
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br>
No stranger in the crowd could doubt `twas Casey at the bat.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br>
Five thousand tongues applauded as he wiped them on his shirt.<br>
Then, while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br>
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br>
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there,<br>
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped --<br>
&quot;That ain't my style,&quot; said Casey. &quot;Strike one,&quot; the umpire
said.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br>
Like the beating of the storm waves on a stern and distant shore.<br>
&quot;Kill him; kill the umpire!&quot; shouted someone from the stand;--<br>
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br>
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br>
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;<br>
But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, &quot;Strike two.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Fraud,&quot; cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered
&quot;Fraud,&quot;<br>
But one scornful look from Casey, and the multitude was awed.<br>
The saw his face grow stern and cold; they saw his muscles strain,<br>
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The sneer is gone from Casey's lip; his teeth are clenched in hate;<br>
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br>
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,<br>
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Oh! somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;<br>
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light.<br>
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;<br>
But there is no joy in Mudville -- mighty Casey has Struck Out.<br>

<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><center><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="5">Casey's Revenge</font></center><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<font face="Bookman Old Style">
There were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;<br>
There were muttered oaths and curses -- every fan in town was sore.<br>
&quot;Just think,&quot; said one, &quot;how soft it looked with Casey at the
bat!<br>
And then to think he'd go and spring a bush-league trick like that.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">All his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless &quot;shine.&quot;<br>
They called him &quot;Strike-out Casey&quot; from the mayor down the line,<br>
And as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,<br>
While a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey's eye.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again,<br>
And fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men.<br>
And Casey smiled -- his rugged face no longer wore a frown;<br>
The pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">All Mudville had assembled; ten thousand fans had come<br>
To see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;<br>
And when he stepped into the box, the multitude went wild.<br>
He doffed his cap in proud disdain -- but Casey only smiled.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Play ball!,&quot; the umpire's voice rang out, and then the game began;<br>
But in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan<br>
Who thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun<br>
Their hopes sank low -- the rival team was leading &quot;four to one.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;<br>
But when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.<br>
The din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard<br>
When the pitcher hit the second and gave &quot;four balls&quot; to the third.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Three men on base -- nobody out -- three runs to tie the game!<br>
A triple meant the highest niche in Mudville's hall of fame;<br>
But here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night<br>
When the fourth one &quot;fouled to catcher&quot; and the fifth &quot;flew out
to right.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">A dismal groan in chorus came -- a scowl was on each face --<br>
When Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;<br>
His bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate;<br>
He gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">But fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;<br>
There were no wild and wooly cheers, no glad acclaim this day.<br>
They hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, &quot;Strike him out!&quot;<br>
But Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard this shout.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">The pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread;<br>
Another hiss, another groan. &quot;Strike one!&quot; the umpire said.<br>
Zip! Like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee--<br>
&quot;Strike two!&quot; the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">No roasting for the umpire now -- his was an easy lot;<br>
But here the pitcher whirled again -- was that a rifle shot?<br>
A whack! a crack! and out through space the leather pellet flew,<br>
A blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Above the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight,<br>
The sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.<br>
Ten thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit,<br>
But no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit!</font>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style">Oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun.<br>
And some where bands no longer play children have no fun;<br>
And somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall;<br>
But Mudville hearts are happy now -- for Casey hit the ball!</font>

<p align="center"><b><i><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="5">Casey-Twenty Years Later</font></i></b>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">The Bugville Team was surely up against a rocky game;<br>
The chances were they'd win defeat and undying fame;<br>
Three men were hurt and two were benched; the score stood six to four.<br>
They had to make three hard-earned runs in just two innings more.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;It can't be done,&quot; the captain said, a pallor on his
face;<br>
&quot;I've got two pitchers in the field, a mutt on second base;<br>
And should another man get spiked or crippled in some way,<br>
The team would sure be down and out, with eight men left to play.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;We're up against it anyhow as far as I can see;<br>
My boys ain't hitting like they should and that's what worries me;<br>
The luck is on the other side, no pennant will we win;<br>
It's mighty tough, but we must take our medicine and grin.&quot;<br>
<br>
The eighth round opened; one, two, three; the enemy went down;<br>
The Bugville boys went out the same, the captain wore a frown;<br>
The first half of the ninth came round, two men had been called out,<br>
The Bugville's pitcher broke a thumb and could not go the route.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">A deathly silence settled o'er the crowd assembled there.<br>
Defeat would be allotted them; They felt it in the air;<br>
With only eight men in the field 'twould be a gruesome fray,-<br>
Small wonder that the captain cursed the day he learned to play.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;Lend me a man to finish with,&quot; he begged the other
team;<br>
&quot;Lend you a man?&quot; the foe replied; My boy, you're in a dream;<br>
We want to win the pennant, too-that's what we're doing here.<br>
There's only one thing you can do-call for a volunteer.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">The captain stood and pondered in a listless sort of way;<br>
He never was a quitter and would not be today!<br>
&quot;Is there within the grandstand here&quot;-his voice rang loud and clear-<br>
&quot;A man who has the sporting blood to be a volunteer?&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">Again that awful silence settled o'er the multitude;<br>
Was there a man among them with such recklessness imbued?<br>
The captain stood with cap in hand, while hopeless was his glance,<br>
And then a short and stocky man cried out, &quot;I'll take a chance.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">Into the field he bounded with a step both firm and light;<br>
&quot;Give me the mask and mitt,&quot; he said; &quot;let's finish up the fight.<br>
The game is now beyond recall; I'll last at lest a round;<br>
Although I'm ancient you will find me muscular and sound.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">His hair was sprinkled here and there with little streaks of
gray;<br>
Around his eyes and on his brow a bunch of wrinkles lay.<br>
The captain smiled despairingly and slowly turned away.<br>
&quot;Why, he's all right,&quot; on rooter yelled. Another, &quot;Let him
play.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;All right, go on,&quot; the captain sighed; the stranger
turned around,<br>
Took off his coat and collar, too, and threw them on the ground.<br>
The humor of the situation seemed to hit them all,<br>
And as he donned the mask and mitt, the umpire called, &quot;Play ball!&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">Three balls the pitcher at him hurled, three balls of lightning
speed;<br>
The stranger caught them all with ease and did not seem to heed.<br>
Each ball had been pronounced a strike, the side had been put out,<br>
And as he walked in towards the bench, he heard the rooters shout.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">One Bugville boy went out on strikes, and one was killed at
first;<br>
The captain saw his awkward pose, and gnashed his teeth and cursed.<br>
The third man smashed a double and the fourth man swatted clear,<br>
Then, in a thunder of applause, up came the volunteer.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">His feet were planted in the earth, he swung a warlike club;<br>
The captain saw his awkward pose and softly whispered, &quot;Dub!&quot;<br>
The pitcher looked at him and grinned, then heaved a mighty ball;<br>
The echo of that fearful swat still lingers with us all.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">High fast and far that spheroid flew; it&nbsp;sailed and sailed
away;<br>
It ne'er was found, so it's supposed it still floats on today.<br>
Three runs came in, the pennant would be Bugville's for a year;<br>
The fans and players gathered round to cheer the volunteer.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Bookman Old Style">&quot;What is your name,&quot; the captain asked? &quot;Tell us
your name,&quot; cried all,<br>
as down his cheeks great tears were seen to run and fall.<br>
For one brief moment he was still, then murmured soft and low;<br>
&quot;I'm mighty Casey who struck out just twenty years ago.&quot;</font>

Billy Woodson's place, where in the evening's shade,<br>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">The
grandstand, too, has been torn down; no bleachers met my gaze<br>
Where you and I were wont to sit in happy bygone days;<br>
The peanuts which we fumbled there have sprouted in a row<br>
Where mighty Casey swung in vain just twenty years ago.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">O
how we used to cheer him, Tom, each time he came to bat!<br>
And how we held our breath in awe when on the plate he spat;<br>
And when he landed on the ball, how loud we yelped!<br>
But O how loud we cursed when he struck out some twenty years ago!</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">The
diamond is a corn patch now; the outfield's overgrown<br>
With pumpkin vines and weedy plots; the rooters all have flown -<br>
They couldn't bear to live on there, for nothing was the same<br>
Where they had been so happy once before that fatal game.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">The
village band disbanded soon; the mayor, too resigned.<br>
The council even jumped its graft, and in seclusion pined;<br>
The marshal caught the next train out, and those we used to know<br>
Began to leave in flocks and droves some twenty years ago.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">For
after Casey fanned that day the citizens all left,<br>
And one by one they sought new lands, heartbroken and bereft;<br>
The joyous shout no more rang out of children at their play;<br>
The village blacksmith closed his shop; the druggist moved away.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Alas
for Mudville's vanished pomp when mighty Casey reigned!<br>
Her grandeur has departed now; her glory's long since waned.<br>
Her place upon the map is lost, and no one seems to care<br>
A whit about the old town now since Casey biffed the air.</font></span></p>

The Frog Town Twirler thought he had things pretty much his way,<br>

<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Then

There wasn't even one kind word to boost his game along.<br>

The fans stood ready, if he won, to set the town on fire.</span></font></p>

And a look of straining agony is there to takes its place.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"><font size="3">One
moment Hagen pauses, hides the ball behind his glove,<br>
And then he drives it from him with a sweeping long arm shove.<br>
And now the air is shattered, and the ball's in the catcher's mitt,<br>
For Casey, Might Casey, hadn't figured on the spit!</font></span></font></p>

</span></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">The
prospects seemed all rosy for the Dodger nine that day,<br>
</span><st1:time Minute="56" Hour="14">
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Four to three</span></st1:time>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"> the score stood, with
one man left to play.<br>
And so when Sturm died and Rolfe the Red went out,<br>
In the tall weeds of Canaries you could hear the Dodgers' shout.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">A
measly few got up to go as screaming rent the air. The rest<br>
Were held deep-rooted by Fear's gnaw eternal at the human breast.<br>
They thought with Henrich, Hugh Casey had a cinch.<br>
They could depend on Casey when things stood in the pinch.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">There
was ease in Casey's manner as he stood there in the box.<br>
There was pride in Casey's bearing, from his cap down to his sox.<br>
And when, responding to the cheers, he took up his trousers' sag.<br>
No stranger in the crowd could doubt, he had them in the bag.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Sixty
thousand eyes were on him when Casey toed the dirt.<br>
Thirty thousand tongues applauded as he rubbed his Dodger shirt.<br>
Then while the writhing Henrich stood swaying at the hip.<br>
Contempt gleamed high in Casey's eye. A sneer curled Casey's lip.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">And
now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br>
And Henrich stood awaiting it, with pale and frightened stare.<br>
Close by the trembling Henrich the ball unheeded sped.<br>
&quot;He don't like my style,&quot; said Casey. &quot;Strike one!&quot; the
umpire said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">From
the benches black with people there went up a muffled roar,<br>
Like the thunder of dark storm waves on the </span><st1:place>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Coney Island</span></st1:place>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"> shore.<br>
&quot;Get him! Get him, Casey!&quot; shouted someone in the stand.<br>
Hugh Casey smiled with confidence. Hugh Casey raised his hand.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">With
a smile of kindly charity Great Casey's visage shone.<br>
He stifled the Faithful screaming. He bade the game go on.<br>
He caught Mickey Owen's signal. Once more the spheroid flew.<br>
But Henrich still ignored it. The umpire bawled, &quot;Strike two!&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">&quot;Yay!&quot;
screamed the maddened thousands, and the echo answered, ''YAY!''<br>
But another smile from Casey. He held them under sway.<br>
They saw his strong jaws tighten. They saw his muscles strain,<br>
And they knew that Hughie Casey would get his man again.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Pale
as the lily Henrich's lips; his teeth were clenched in hate.<br>
He pounded with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br>
And now Great Casey held the ball, and now he let it go,<br>
And Brooklyn was shattered by the whiff of Henrich's blow.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">But
Mickey Owen missed this strike. The ball rolled far behind.<br>
And Henrich speeded to first base, like Clipper on the wind.<br>
Upon the stricken multitude grim melancholy perched.<br>
Dark disbelief bowed Hughie's head. It seemed as if he lurched.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">DiMaggio
got a single. Keller sent one to the wall.<br>
Two runs came pounding o'er the dish and oh, this wasn't all.<br>
For Dickey walked and Gordon a resounding double smashed.<br>
And Dodger fans were sickened. And Dodger hopes were bashed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black">Oh
somewhere North of Harlem the sun is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">shining
bright.<span style="color:black"><br>
Bands are playing in the </span></span><st1:place>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: black"> and up there hearts are
light.<br>
In Hunt's Point men are laughing, on the Concourse children shout.<br>
But there is no joy in Flatbush. Fate had knocked their Casey out.</span></font></p>

  Casey's Card</i></b></span></font>
</address>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">The outlook wasn’t great for
finding Casey’s card.<br>
The dealers denied they had him as I fought against the mob.<br>
And then as Cooney was seen in mint and Barrows appeared the same,<br>
a sense of elation came to me in this baseball hobby game.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">A card shark got fed up and passed me
in despair.<br>
The rest clung to their hobby hopes and prayed the Casey card was near;<br>
They thought, by the Topps high numbers, if we could only find his card,<br>
we’ll pay any price even if it’s marred.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Then Flynn (Casey’s mate) was found
in very good-<br>
a crease along his neckline stretched into his wood.<br>
So they all bid to possess that crazy players card<br>
until all turned to silence when Mr. Mint got the final nod.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">After Flynn, they found Jimmy Blake,
a tobacco card mistake;<br>
For Blake was frayed and ugly and had scratches on him from head to toe,<br>
and the collectors were not interested<br>
for the price he fetched was very low.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Then from fifty baseball card
collectors there rose a mighty roar.<br>
It echoed from every table, it bounced off the floor,<br>
it was carried by the newsmen and was heard outside the door,<br>
for the Casey card, the rarest card now everyone saw.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">There was a full gloss in Casey’s
picture as he posed beside the plate<br>
there were full white borders and a hawkish look upon his face.<br>
And from an old shoebox he was raised above the crowd.<br>
This symbol of the hobby now had everyone aroused.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Ten thousand dollars was offered; the
smell of gum hung in the air.<br>
Five thousand more, said another, as he took up on this dare,<br>
Then while the price was raising beyond the hopes of hobby folk,<br>
a disbelief filled the children's minds; for they thought this all was a joke.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">For this gem-mint card was dropped
and fluttered everywhere;<br>
the rarest of cards went flipping and gave them all a scare.<br>
And as the people scattered, poor Casey turned up tales<br>
and silence filled this card show and ended all the sales.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">From the dealers came a mumble that
roused up to a roar.<br>
Then the auctioneer came over and looked down on what they saw.<br>
“Raise him! Raise him!” shouted the newsmen from the back.<br>
But no one would pick up Casey as he lay by some wax packs.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Like some curse from the devil,
Casey’s origin was on display<br>
and the owner’s face turned to horror for there would be soon hell to pay;<br>
so he signaled to a friend to sell a Mantle rookie card,<br>
but the words on Casey’s back would forever leave him scarred.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">“Reprint!” shouted everyone at
once, and the echo answered “Reprint!”<br>
to all this now lonely bunch; But baseball card collectors are not a discouraged
race,<br>
for now the plastic pages were turning at a faster pace.<br>
They passed up a Wagner and ignored a perfect Cobb, just to find again the
mighty Casey card<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">The smiles soon vanished from the
children’s lips as they too joined in this game;<br>
and I who viewed these mental flips thought everyone there insane.<br>
And now someone gave a TV pitch in search of this cardboard gold,<br>
asking everyone to even check their attics as this story is being told.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="3">Oh, somewhere
Casey’s card is out there, or so these dreamers think,<br>
for they will stir up this hobby nation until they find this missing link;<br>
and somewhere I am laughing, for I made up that baseball card,<br>
and the re-finding of poor Casey will indeed be very hard.<o:p>

Now the little boy doesn't say a word, picks up his ball he is undeterred.
Says, &quot;I am the greatest that there has ever been&quot; 
And he grits his teeth and he tries again.
And the ball goes up and the ball comes down, 
Swings his bat all the way around
The world so still you can hear the sound, the baseball falls to the ground.
He makes no excuses he shows no fear 
He just closes his eyes and listens to the cheers.
Little boy he adjusts his hat, picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says &quot;I am the greatest when the game is on the line&quot; 
And he gives his all one last time.
And the ball goes up and the moon so bright 
Swings his bat with all his might
The world's as still as still can be, the baseball falls 
And that's strike three.
Now it's suppertime and his momma calls, 
little boy starts home with his bat and ball.
Says, &quot;I am the greatest, that is a fact, 
But even I didn't know I could pitch like that!&quot;
Says, &quot;I am the greatest, that is understood, 
But even I didn't know I could pitch that good!&quot;</font></pre><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times">
