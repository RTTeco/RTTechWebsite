<p align="center">EXPLORING TECHNOLOGY<br>
MATERIALS PROCESSING<br>
NON METALS (PLASTICS) AREA</p>

<p>You will have an opportunity to learn useful knowledge of the plastics industry by
injection molding, using the coating process, and open casting a product using synthetic
materials. The methods used to produce molded products are different because patterns are
different. Yet the procedure followed to make the products and prepare them for
distribution (shipping) is generally the same. There are six steps in this procedure.
However, not all of the six steps may be necessary. This depends on the product being
made. Raw materials are provided by nature. They may be grown such as trees, cotton, and
grain, or raised such as sheep and cattle. Others are extracted (taken) from the ground,
water, or air, iron ore, petroleum, and oxygen. The first step in production is to change
the raw material into a form useful for making a product. Iron ore is a raw material, but
it is useless until it is refined (has impurities removed). Then it can be combined with
other refined minerals to make steel. In the same way, a tree cannot be used to make a
product until it is changed into lumber. These raw materials are sometimes called
industrial materials. A raw material is more useful when it is converted (changed) into
standard stock or sometimes referred to as industrial materials . This means that the
material is formed into a standard (widely used) size and shape. Think how hard it would
be to work with and transport (move) a thick piece of steel the size of your classroom.
Standard stock sizes are smaller and easier to handle. Also, planning products is easier
when the sizes and shapes or materials are known. Lumber and sheet metal, for example, can
be purchased in standard sizes. Standard stock is made into the components (individual
parts) of a product. Some products have one component, such as a comb, a key, or a coin.
Many products are made up of many individual components. The handle grip is one component
of a motorcycle. The lead and the eraser are components of a pencil. The components are
assembled (put together in a planned way) with other components. This can be done by a
number of methods. Components may be put together with glue, by welding, or with screws,
bolts, or nails. A combination of methods may be used. The motorcycle handle grip is
assembled with the handlebar to make a subassembly. The lead and eraser are assembled with
other components to make a pencil. When all the components are assembled and inspected,
the result is a finished product. Motorcycles, pencil, nuclear submarines, space shuttles,
and safety pins are all finished products. Often, finished products are components of
other products. For example, the light bulb is a finished component of a desk lamp. Tires
are finished components of the motorcycle. The finished product is prepared for
distribution to protect in during shipping. Many products need to be placed in packages to
protect them or make them easy to handle. Products are usually stored in a warehouse
(storage building) before shipment to consumers. They are then loaded onto trucks, trains,
boats, or planes, or pumped into pipelines to be transported to the consumer. In
this
booklet you will learn about how standard stock materials are cast or molded into
components or one piece finished products. Casting or molding is a forming process in which
standard stock in liquid form or semi-liquid form is poured or pumped into the cavity
(hollow space) of a mold or die. The liquid takes the shape of the walls of the cavity. It
then hardens so that it will keep that shape. The finished piece is called a casting, or a
molded part. It has the size, shape, and finish of the mold cavity in which it was
made. The standard stock for molding plastic comes in the form of liquid, powder, or
pellets. Before solid standard stock can be cast or molded, it must be heated until it
becomes a liquid or semi-liquid. The plastic you will be using in your product will become
liquid at a temperature of 400-450 degrees. The cavity of the mold must be an empty space
just the size and shape of the part or product to be cast. Also, workers must be able to
get the hardened casting out of the mold or in some cases from around the outside of the
mold. Some castings use the same mold over and over again. These molds are called permanent
ones that can be used for casting parts that are needed in large numbers, like tires, auto
trim, gears, toys, and even paper clips that you have an opportunity to produce.</p>

<p>THE COATING PROCESS</p>

<p>A dipping process involves the coating of a item with plastic. The item may or may not
be hot when it is dipped. Vinyl dipping, fluidized bed coating and cold dipping are three
process that can be used to coat an object. Vinyl dipping is a process of apply a coating
to a mold or metal object. The plastic can be removed from the mold to make a product or
it may be left on the object to provide a permanent coating. Vinyl dipping involves the
use of a vinyl dispersion which is a liquid resin where finely ground vinyl particles are
suspended in a plasticizer. Plastisols are one type of vinyl dispersion. Vinyl is
suspended in a plasticizer which is similar to oil. Heat drives off some of the
plasticizer and the vinyl particles are dissolved in the remainder to form a flexible
product or coating. Organosols are similar to plastisols, except the vinyl particles are
suspended in a solvent. When the solvent evaporates, a thin flexible coating is left on
the object. Vinyl dispersions are used to coat paper and fabrics and to cast regular and
embossed vinyl film. There are many advantages to using a vinyl dispersion to coat metal
item. Vinyl dispersions, when cured, have similar characteristics to other vinyl's. They
resist attack from most solvents and chemicals and thus protect the metal from corrosion.
Since the metal is covered, it is protected against moisture and the formation of rust.
The coating is very tough, yet resilient, and will add decoration to the coated part. The
biggest disadvantage of using a vinyl dispersion is the variation in thickness of the
coating. As the object is removed from the dispersion, the excess material runs off. This
causes a thicker coating at the bottom of the object. The draining takes time which
increases the cycle time and leaves a dimple on the bottom edge. Irregular shaped objects
are usually difficult to coat items such as perforated metal or any object with holes
should not be vinyl dipped as the dispersion tends to fill the holes. Cloth gloves can be
dipped into a vinyl dispersion to provide them with a waterproof coating. A mandrel,
shaped like a hand, can be dipped and cured. The item, stripped from the mandrel, will
produce elastic waterproof gloves. Boots and rubbers also are made this way. Wire goods,
such as dish drainer baskets, may be coated with a dispersion. Large and small tools
handles can also be coated using vinyl dispersion to give comfort and electrical
insulation. Before you begin with your plastic projects, become familiar with the equipment
and the terminology. Read through the instructions first before you begin. Safety
First
Safety is an important part of every job. Working with hand tools can be dangerous. It's
important to respect the sharp edges and points that tools have. Resins can be messy and
difficult to clean up. They can stain your clothes and damage your eyes. The curing of
plastics require high heat. Be aware of items that may be hot. Always think
&quot;safety&quot;. Work carefully and make sure you read the instructions. If you need
assistance, be sure to ask for help. Don't wait until it is too late. Lets get started!</p>

<p>PRODUCING A VINYL DISPERSION</p>

<p>The process of vinyl dipping can be used to make a coin purse, ball hitch, funnel,
icky picker upper or used to coat tool handles. The oven as well as the mandrel will be hot.
Never pick up a mandrel with your bare hand unless you are absolutely sure that is cold.
Dispersions are messy. Be sure that you have plenty of newspaper under your work. Heat the
oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit by turning the thermostat to the right. Check the
thermometer to see that the proper operating temperature is reached. Make sure the hanger
support is in the oven.Throughly mix the vinyl dispersion that you will be using with a
mixing stick. If this is not done the vinyl will settle on the bottom of the can and will
not attach to you product. Place the mandrel in the oven that has been preheated to a
temperature of 400 degrees. A cold mandrel will take about 20 to 30 minutes to heat. The
larger mandrels like the ball hitch mold will require more time to preheat. The hotter the
mandrel is the thicker and stronger the vinyl will become. Remove the mandrel from the
oven using a pair of pliers, gripping the suspension wire at the top. Close the oven door
as soon as possible to prevent to much heat loss. Spray the mandrel lightly with mold
release. A mold release is used so the plastic will not stick to the mold. Dip the mandrel
in the plastisol for 1 1/2 minutes (90 seconds). Be sure the mandrel is covered completely
with the plastisol. Note: If you are dipping the ball hitch, or the ping pong ball gun
molds. Do not completely dip the mandrel in the vinyl. Only immerse it to about 1/4 of a
inch from the top edge of the mandrel. Do not touch the side or bottom of the cans as this
will cause a defect in the product. If you touch another mandrel, this will also cause a
defect. Always complete the process, no matter what the defect. The plastisol must be
cured before it can be removed; washing with water will not remove the plastisol. After
1
1/2 minutes (90 seconds), raise the mandrel so that the excess plastisol can drain back
into the container. Hold a piece of scrap paper under the mandrel as you place it back
into the oven. The plastisol must be cured for about 5 minutes at 400 degrees. There will
be some smoke coming from the oven. Check the product occasionally so it does not burn.
Normally when the colors of the vinyl become bright, the vinyl is now cured. Remove the
mandrel and place it into the cold water bucket. Hang the product on the wire support. Do
not drop it in the bucket, the plastic is still soft and you will put a defect in you
project. Allow it to cool for 5 minutes. The vinyl may seem cool after several minutes,
but remember that plastics are good insulators and the mandrel will be quite hot. Trim
around the wire using a linoleum knife. Be careful that you do not cut yourself. Use a
metal straight edge and the linoleum knife to slit on side of the purse. You can carefully
strip the finished product form the mandrel. The mandrel can be placed back in the oven
and reused the following day. If your vinyl dispersion is thin, it indicates that the
mandrel was not heated to the proper temperature or that it was not dipped in the
plastisol long enough, or the vinyl was not mixed properly. If the dispersion was cured
properly, it will be difficult to tear. The ball hitch, ping pong ball gun, and funnel
molds need no trimming and the vinyl can be slipped off the mandrel. If you coated tools,
leave the vinyl alone. Option: Use the leather punch or an awl to poke two holes in one
end of your coin purse and thread a bead chain through it. </p>

<p>THE INJECTION MOLDING PROCESS</p>

<p>Injection molding is a process where a plasticized thermoplastic is injected or forced
under pressure into a closed mold where it cools to form a product. The term plasticize
means to soften a plastic material, usually with heat, so that it can be molded or shaped.
Over 60 percent of all thermoplastics are processed by injection molding. John and Isaiah
Hyatt are credited with developing the first method of injection thermoplastics in 1872.
Later developments by Author Eichengrun in 1919 led to the development of a more practical
injection molder which was hand operated. Injection molding was never fully developed
until 1935. Since then it has become the most important process in the plastics industry. In
injection molding, thermoplastic pellets are fed, from a hopper, into a heated
barrel where they are plasticized by heat. The plastic is then forced by a ram out through
the nozzle into a closed mold. In an industrial machine, all operations of the process are
controlled by hydraulic pressure. The machine you will use is a air operated 1 ounce
machine which means the largest item that can be molded will weigh 1 ounce. Larger
industrial machines deliver as much as 910 ounces of material per shot. Our injection
molding machine uses a single cavity mold. In a larger machines a multi cavity mold is use
for high production rates. Large demand, 10,000 or more parts, to make the process
economically feasible. One advantage to using thermoplastics for injection molding is that
parts with defects can be ground up and reused. Once an industrial production machine is
set up, about all the operator has to do, aside from checking on product quality and
proper functioning of the equipment, is remove the parts if it is being operated on
semi-automatic or if it is operated on automatic, the operator removes the sprue and
runners. A sprue is a channel in a mold where the plastic enters the mold. Runners branch
off the sprue to carry the plastic to the other cavities in the mold. Before you begin
with your plastic projects, become familiar with the equipment and the terminology. Read
through the instructions first before you begin. Safety First Safety is an important part
of every job. Working with hand tools can be dangerous. It's important to respect the
sharp edges and points that tools have. Resins can be messy and difficult to clean up.
They can stain your clothes and damage your eyes. The curing of plastics require high
heat. Be aware of items that may be hot. Always think &quot;safety&quot;. Work carefully
and make sure you read the instructions. If you need assistance, be sure to ask for help.
Don't wait until it is too late.</p>

<p>Lets get started!</p>

<p>PRODUCING INJECTION MOLDED PRODUCTS</p>

<p>Turn thermostat knob to a little past medium. This should result in the temperature of
about 400 degrees. Note the pilot lamp should glow. Do not operate the air ram until the
machine is at the operating temperature. The machine will take about 15 minutes to heat
up. In a small jar, mix a small amount of color pigment with the polystyrene beads. Do not
mix more than you are going to use. You may produce as many paper clips and guitar picks
as you would like. You may inject a scratch awl, small phillips screw driver and a small
standard screwdriver handle. Color the beads by shaking them in the jar. When the molder
reaches the proper operating temperature, purge any material from the barrel that may been
left, do this by operating the air ram. Using a spoon, fill the barrel and hopper with your
colored pellets. Allow them to heat for a few minutes. Apply a light coat of mold release
to the mold. A mold release is used so the plastic will not stick to the mold. Place the
mold under the nozzle and clamp it in place. Do not clamp the mold to tight. Over
tighten will make it difficult to remove the mold. A little practice will allow for the right
pressure. Operate the four way two position valve to push the ram down the barrel. Operate
this valve for only a few seconds. If you hold the valve too long, the mold will be to
full and flash lines will appear. Flash is the leaking of material where the mold surfaces
are held together. If you hold the valve for to short of a time the cavity will not
completely fill and the result will be a &quot;short shot&quot;. Once again, practice will
allow you to regulate this time. Do not throw away any short or long shots. Long shots can
be trimmed. All plastics used in this machine can be ground up and reused. Raise the ram
and recharge the barrel and hopper. Loosen the clamp and remove the mold. Carefully open
the mold and remove the finished product. Be careful the plastic may still hot and
soft. With a little practice you will be able to produce many products with little or no
trimming to do at all. Turn off the injection molder when not in use and unplug it from
the wall outlet.</p>

<p>POLYESTER CASTING</p>

<p>Casting is a process of pouring a liquid resin into an open or closed mold and allowing
the resin to cure. In casting a polyester resin, the resin is mixed with a catalyst
and
coloring material and poured into a mold to cure. The polyester is a thermoset plastic and
will generate its own heat from the chemical reaction. No external heat is required. A
thermosetting plastic is a material that can only be used one time. A thermosetting
plastic can not be reused or recycled. Acrylics, plastisols, polyester and epoxies are the
most popular plastics used for casting. The first casting resins were prone to cracking and
crazing. Around 1925 other plastics were introduced to prevent these problems. World War
II led to the development of acrylics and polyesters for casting. Polyester was used for
casting the canopies for fighter planes during the war. Molds for casting can be made from
a variety of materials. Rubber, glass, and other plastics are common mold materials. They
are less expensive to make than other molds. The casting process does not require
expensive equipment to manufacture a product. The cycle time for curing thermoset is long,
and the casting process does not lend itself to high production. Large and small statuary
items such as chessmen, knickknacks, costume jewelry, handles, dice, poker chips, and
dominoes are common cast items. Most casting materials consists of a resin base to which a
catalyst is added to cause final hardening. The process involves:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Preparation of a suitable mold. Pouring the resin. Removal of product from the
mold.&nbsp;Finishing the product. Polyester and epoxy casting resins are quite similar.
They are obtained as clear liquid resin base as standard stock. Coloring is add to
according the users preferences. Before you begin with your plastic projects, become
familiar with the equipment and the terminology. Read through the instructions first
before you begin. Safety First Safety is an important part of every job. Working with hand
tools can be dangerous. It's important to respect the sharp edges and points that tools
have. Resins can be messy and difficult to clean up. They can stain your clothes and
damage your eyes. Always think &quot;safety&quot;. Work carefully and make sure you read
the instructions. If you need assistance, be sure to ask for help. Don't wait until it is
too late.</p>

<p>Lets get started!</p>

<p>PRODUCING A POLYESTER CASTING</p>

<p>Prepare a suitable mold. You have your choice and you may cast more than one item. The
mold for this process are small. The reason for this is that the resin will generate heat.
Too much resin will generate to much heat, resulting in damaging the mold. Please use the
resin carefully and do not waste it. Make sure the mold is clean and dry. Apply a thin
coating of mold release to the inside surface of the mold. Pour into a paper cup the proper
amount of resin. This should be done in a well ventilated area. Polyester can be messy
when spilled. Be sure that you have plenty of newspaper under your work. Add the coloring
to the resin. Add just a few drops, do not make your casting to dark, it looks ugly. Next
you need to add the catalyst. The catalyst is methyl ethyl ketone. Add only 10 to 12 drops
of catalyst per ounce of resin. To much catalyst will generate to high of heat and will
ruin the mold. To little catalyst will not allow the resin to cure. The mixture should be
stirred slowly for a few minutes being careful not to trap air bubbles with a stirring
stick. The resin is then poured slowly into the mold to the proper level. Curing time takes
from 2 to 6 hours depending upon the amount of catalyst and size of the mold. 24 hours is
best. Cover your project with a piece of news paper, fold it like a tent so the paper does
not come in contact with the resin, and store until the next day. The day the casting
should be cured. Touch the casting with a small stick or toothpick to make sure the
casting is cured. If you touch it, a finger print will result. If the casting is hard
remove it from the mold and the mold can be reused. If the product is not quite cured,
place the mold upside down on a sheet of glass and place the sheet of glass in the oven on
low heat. Leave until the next day and this should cure the product. Some molded products
require a round objects and the mold must be broken in order to remove the product. These
mold are referred as one shot molds because they can be used only one time. An example of
with mold would be somewhat like using a light bulb for a mold. Final finishing can be
accomplished by filing, sanding and buffing with a polishing wheel. If done properly, very
little or no finishing will be required. Begin sanding your product with 120 or 150 grit
sand paper. Sand in one direction with a back and forth motion. When finished there will
be scratches in one direction only. With a finer piece of paper from the last one use sand
in the opposite direction with a back and forth motion. You will know when you have
replaced the old scratches with new ones when all the new scratches are in the same
direction you are sanding. Continue this process until you reach 240 grit sand paper.
Using a 400 wet and dry paper and using water as a lubricant most all scratches will be
removed. It is very important to follow this sanding procedure. If you skip steps or do a
poor sanding job, you will never be able to polish out the deep scratches. After all
scratches have been removed by sanding. Begin polishing using tripoli on a muslin buffing
wheel. Polish the product from the center downward. If you try to polish the entire
project it will out of you hand and may chip or even break. After on half is finished, turn
it around and do the other half. Be sure to wear safety glasses. Do not use buffing wheels
for metal on plastics you will ruin them. Check with your instructor before you begin. </p>

<p>WEP - Water Extended Polyester</p>

<p>Water-extended polyester resin is a new way to employ unsaturated polyester resin in an
inexpensive, highly useful form, containing water. Composites are produced from water
emulsions of special resins. When cured, they exhibit the properties of commercial
polyesters of good quality, strength, chemical resistance and versatility. The emulsions
are thermosetting and when cured they are white to off white and resemble fine grain
plaster or concrete. Cured WEP can be nailed, sawed, machined. WEP resin can be dyed with
pigments or oils, but is many times left it natural color and then painted. Because they
are inexpensive, WEP is used in molding the larger molds that we have in out lab. Batches
up to several gallons can be made conveniently. WEP is primarily designed for casting and
for production art objects, furniture parts, lamps and exterior garden statues. Also
larger castings are made from WEP because of the curing temperature. Conventional
polyester (like you did in a previous project) can reach a curing temperature of 300
degrees while WEP may reach a temperature of about 140 degrees. The process involves:
&nbsp; Preparation of a suitable mold.&nbsp; Mixing the resin Pouring the
resin.&nbsp;Removal of product from the mold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finishing the product.
Before you begin with your plastic projects, become familiar with the equipment and the

<p>Lets get started!</p>

<p>PRODUCING A WATER EXTENDED POLYESTER CASTING</p>

<p>Prepare a suitable mold. You have your choice and you may cast more than one item. In
fact, the larger the amount of WEP prepared, the easier the process is. Get together with
you partner and decide which molds you would like to do. The alphabet is very popular. If
you do choose to do letters, make sure you do vowels and multiple used letters first. Then
do the remaining letters another day. Make sure the mold is clean and dry. Apply a thin
coating of mold release to the inside surface of the mold. Polyester can be messy when
spilled. Be sure that you have plenty of newspaper under your molds. Measure the volume of
each of the molds with water. Pour one half as much WEP as the volume of all the molds
into a suitable container. Into another container pour the same amount of water as the WEP
plus 8 ounces. Slowly add the water to the WEP while stirring with a paint stirring paddle
and drill press or air motor at approximately 2000 rpm. By pouring down the spinning shaft
of the paddle will minimize splattering. Do not add the water all at once. The WEP should
turn a white milk color when mixed properly. This mixing process can take up to twenty
minutes. Secure the catalyst. 5 drops per ounce of the WEP resin used (not the total
mixture). Count out the number of drops into a small vial. Add the catalyst to the blended
WEP/Water mixture for 2 minutes only. Pour into molds. Allow to harden overnight. Remove
the casting from the molds. Sand any rough edges and or the backs of your castings. Paint
as desired. If this casting is to be hung on a wall. holes will be needed in the back for
hanging purposes.</p>
