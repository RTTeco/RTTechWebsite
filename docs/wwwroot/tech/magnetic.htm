<p align="center">A New American Railroad</p>

<p align="left"><br>
From downtown Boston, 450 miles to the center of the nation's capital, Washington D.C., in
90 minutes, at prices cheaper than Am-trak's Metro liner? For the more than 1 million
people who make that journey every year by air, this may seem like a fantasy. But it
isn't. Such is the prospect which lies before us early in the 21st century, if we
implement some type of program for investment in magnetic levitation (Maglev) transport
systems.<br>
Here's what such a trip would be like. Passengers arrive at Boston's main station via a
network of Magellan commuter lines, at more than 50 miles per hour, shortly before the
scheduled 7:30 a.m. departure of the morning express service to Washington, D.C., perhaps
to be known as The 21stCentury Unlimited. There are no worries about traffic jams or
parking spaces. On board, passengers relax in quiet comfort, while The Unlimited
accelerates at nearly three feet per second per second to a cruising speed of about 300
mph.<br>
Following a re-engineered route from Boston to Providence, R.l., and then along the
Connecticut coastal strip, (see map) the first, and only stop, New York City, would be at
about 8:15 a.m. From there, The Unlimited would speed toward Washington, D.C., along
roughly the same path Am-trak's Metro liner now follows, arriving at around 9:00 a.m., the
beginning of the working day.</p>

<p align="left">Sound far-fetched, like science fiction? Outside the United States, maglev
train systems are fast becoming reality. Germany has such a system ready, now, for
commercial application. Japan will also, before the end of the decade. Rapid development
of maglev technology for the U. S. A.., and the construction of a maglev transportation
network, maybe a cornerstone of transportation policy for the United States. A high-speed
line through the dense population concentrations of the Eastern Seaboard would be the
first part of the new national network. To help revive manufacturing in the nation's
heartland the area bounded by Lake Erie and Michigan to the north, the Illinois River to
the west, and the Ohio River system to the south and east. Drive lines westward, through
Buffalo, NY in the north, and Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania. These would connect the
industrial centers along the shores of Lake Ontario, Lake Michigan, and Lake Erie, and
central Ohio, with the East Coast and the Chicago-northern Indiana industrial belt could
also be possible. The 900-mile journey from New York to Chicago would be completed in three
hours-city center to city center. Intermediate stops on the southern route would include
Pittsburgh, Columbus or Dayton, Ohio, and on to Chicago through Union City, Marion, and
Peru in Indiana. The northern route would pass from Boston through Albany, Rochester, and
Buffalo in New York, Cleveland and Toledo in Ohio, then across the southern Michigan
peninsula, and Gary, Indiana to Chicago (map). The next step in construction of the new
American railroad would be north-south lines to connect the cities of the Lake Shore belt
with the cities of the Ohio Valley, and points farther south and west. Magnetic levitation:
A suspension and propulsion system for trains, based upon the operational principles of a
magnet, also maglev train, a high speed ground transportation vehicle levitated above a
track called a guide way and propelled by magnetic fields. The principles of these magnets
were developed by the 18th century French scientist Charles Augustin De Coulomb. coulomb's
law states: Like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. The north and
south poles of a magnet will pull together, while a north and a north or a south and a
south pole will push away from each other. Maglev is short for magnetic levitation, a fancy
way of saying floating on magnets. A great deal of research as been developed to produce
super conducting materials. Super conducting materials are those that produce little or no
resistance to the flow of electricity . These advancements are leading the way to improved
and highly efficient magnets. These magnets can then be used to levitate or raise vehicles
on a magnetic field. Instead of pounding along on tires or rails, the vehicle floats
several inches above its guide way on a cushion of magnetism. By reducing the friction made
when two materials rub against each other this will make the vehicle much more efficient.
As the development of super conducting material improves, magnetic levitation will
certainly become more feasible. Magnetic levitation train technology can be used for urban
travel at relatively low speeds (100km/h or 62 mph). A short distance maglev shuttle has
been operating since 1984 between Birmingham, England, airport and the city train station.
However, the greatest world wide interest is in high speed maglev systems. Train speeds of
517 km/h (321 mph) have been demonstrated by a full size maglev vehicle in Japan, while in
Germany a maglev train has run at 435 km/h (270 mph). Maglev Systems Two different
approaches to magnetic levitation train systems have been developed. Those in which the
systems are onboard the vehicles, such as Japan's HSST (High Speed Super Transport) models,
and those which are propelled and controlled from the track on which the vehicles run,
known as the guide way. Both the German TR-07 and the Japanese MLU-002 models make use of
what are called passive systems. However, the German and Japanese programs make use of
different electromagnetic principles to provide the suspension, propulsion, and guidance
of their vehicles. The first, called electromagnetic suspension (EMS), uses conventional
electromagnets mounted at the ends of a pair of structures under the train; the structures
wrap around and under either side of the guide way. The magnets attract up toward laminated
iron rails in the guide way and lift the train. However, this system is inherently
unstable; the distance between the electromagnets and the guide way, which is about 10 mm
(3/8), must be continuously monitored and adjusted by computer to prevent the train from
hitting the guide way. The German Tran rapid is based on the attractive power of these
magnetic forces, (Figure 1). The vehicle's under frame &quot;wraps around&quot; the
guide way and pushes the vehicle up and off its rails. The second design, called
electrodynamics suspension (EDS), uses the opposing force between super conducting
magnets
on the vehicle and electrically conductive strips or coils in the guide way to levitate the
train. This approach is stable and does not require the continued monitoring that the EMS
system needs. In the EDS system the distance between the guide way and the train are
greater <br>
(4 to 6 inches). However the EDS trains use super conducting magnets, which are more
expensive than conventional electromagnets and they also require refrigeration to keep the
magnets at a very low temperature. The Japanese also make use of repulsive forces in the
electrodynamics Suspension system (Figure 2), to lift the vehicle away from the guide way.
These systems must employ an undercarriage-like landing-gear, for lift-off and landing,
because the vehicles only levitate at speeds in excess of 25 mph. Magnetic levitation
trains in Germany and Japan are capable of reaching speeds up to 300 miles per hour. Maglev
systems offer a number of advantages over conventional trains that use steel wheels on
steel rails. Because magnetic levitation trains do not touch the guide way, maglev systems
over come the principle limitation of wheeled trains; the high cost of maintaining precise
alignment of the tracks to avoid excessive vibration and rail deterioration at high
speeds. Maglevs can provide sustained speeds greater than 500 km/h (300 mph), limited only
by the cost of power to overcome wind resistance. The fact that maglevs do not touch the
guide way also has other advantages: faster acceleration and braking; greater climbing
capability; enhanced operation in heavy rain, snow, and ice. Maglev transportation would
be a solution to mass transit problems in major metropolitan areas where traffic on ground
and air have become major problems. The major appeals of the maglev solution is its high
speed, safety, environmentally clean and low noise. Maglev systems are also energy
efficient; for distances of several hundred miles, they use about half the energy per
passenger as a typical commercial aircraft. Electrified transportation systems, such as
maglev systems, also the use of petroleum, and pollute the air less than aircraft, diesel
locomotives, and automobiles. Implementing a maglev system will create thousands of jobs
for high level scientists, engineers, technicians and managers, as well as construction
crews and laborers across the country. Made in the U.S.A. Although the vehicles are not
being tested or built in the United States or Canada, some American cities are interested
in purchasing systems for their mass transportation needs. Some electromagnetic levitation
systems will likely be developed in the near future in the Western Hemisphere. After
all,
these maglev trains are nothing but modern versions of a technology outlined by U.S. space
pioneer Robert Goddard early in the 20th century. Maglev technology was pioneered on Long
Island New York in the 1960's by two Brookhaven National Laboratory scientists, James
Powell and Gordon Danby, under a Federal Railroad Administration program sponsored under
the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965. who used super conducting magnets for
maglev trains. This was recognized world wide as a break through because of the super
magnets power to lift enormous weights. The linear electric motor, the power source for
all current maglev prototypes, In 1971, contracts were awarded the Ford Motor Company and
Stanford Research Institute for experimental development of maglev power sources.
Low-speed propulsion systems for cities were advanced by Rohr Industries, with Boeing
taking up the development rights. In 1972, Henry Kolm, of Magneplane International and
Richard Thorton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology built a magneplane concept
featuring repulsive super conducting magnet with a semi-circular guide way that permits self
banking suspension without a secondary suspension system. In 1974, a world speed record of
255.4 mph was set by a prototype linear induction motor vehicle at the Department of
Transportation's Pueblo, Colorado test facility. Just one year later, in 1975, federal
funding for the program was cut, when the Ford administration and Congress allowed the
1965 act to lapse. At least 10 years ahead of the rest of the world at the time, the
United States is now completely out of the running. In 1975 the United States abandoned
research on the maglev device to Germany and Japan. The system's potential is completely
obscured by the cost-benefit analysis tolerated in the United States-which have been used
to keep our nation's infrastructure and speed our transportation to keep up with our
population in a post-industrial society. Comparable in effective travel time over
distances from 200 to 900 miles with aircraft, a maglev unit can carry twice the
passengers at half the cost of a plane such as today's Boeing 737. The system is cheaper
than the movement of' passengers on today's railroad system. Best estimates of maglev
operating and maintenance costs per passenger-mile are 5¢ in 1988 dollars. This is vastly
less., than the passenger-mile cost of today's Metro liner, figured at between 16.2¢ and
36¢, depending on book-keeping methods used. Maglev systems would actually pay for
themselves-in wasted passenger-hours saved. estimates are that $40 billion of economic
value is lost to traffic delays in the nation's eight most congested urban centers-a sum
which could finance the construction of 3,000 miles of maglev rail networks every year.
The industries and jobs which will be created to build such a national system will return
far more, in increased productivity, and permanent improvements to the nation's depleted
capital stock, as will the network itself; than the construction will ever cost. If
a
Maglev system could be developed such industries as the leading edge of an export drive,
in which the United States will begin shipping state-of-the-art capital goods to help the
nations of the Southern Hemisphere develop the economic infrastructure they need to
prosper in the 21st century. The jobs and industries created under this new American
Railroad maglev program, will be here to stay. In Germany and Japan High-speed maglev
transportation systems (HSST) are already being built in Germany and Japan. In Germany,
the Tran rapid system has received government approval for commercial operations. Its
first phase will connect the airports of Cologne-Bonn and Düsseldorf, and later Essen.
The Tran rapid soon expects approval for mainline, intercity operations. This program is
about seven years ahead of the maglev program in Japan, where the MLU system is scheduled
to begin transporting passengers in the densely populated 320 square mile
Tokyo-Nagoya-Osaka corridor by the end of the decade. Germany and Japan have also developed
systems such as the M-Bahn, the 50 mph magnetically levitated urban transit system, which
functions in Berlin, and the HSST Corporation's systems, which have provided vehicles for
exposition sites in Tsukba and Yokohama in Japan, and Vancouver, British Columbia, in
Canada. Maglev technology is already set to meet a family of transportation functions,
from short-distance, but relative high-speed urban commutes-Japan's HSST can function at
between 60 and 250 mph-to intercity travel at speeds in excess of 310 mph. The Transrapid
TR-07 is capable of carrying up to 200 passengers at speeds of up to 310 mph. With a
one-minute headway between units, Germany's TR-07 can transport between 10,000 and 20,000
people per hour. Japan's commercial design maglev train will consist of 14 cars capable of
carrying 900 passengers, and is intended to move 75 -100,000 people per day between Tokyo
and Osaka. Maglev is set to revolutionize passenger and freight transportation worldwide by
early in the next century, just as the steam engine revolutionized transportation more
than 150 years ago. Given the spin-off's which will follow the development of the
transportation systems themselves, such as impetus given to so-called
&quot;high-temperature&quot; superconductor scientific research, the effect will be even
more profound. Current plans for high speed maglev systems include a 283 km (175 mile)
Berlin to Hamburg route in Germany. This has been approved by the German parliament to
begin in the year 2005. In Japan, a 43 km (27 mile) maglev test track in under
construction in Yamanashi Prefecture, about 100 km (62 miles) west of Tokyo. After tests
on the latest maglev vehicle are completed, the test track is planned to be extended to
Tokyo and Osaka. This new commercial line will relieve passenger demand on the Shinkansen
high speed train that currently operates at peak speeds of 225 km (140 mph). Currently
a
consortium of four major United States companies, Grumman, Bechtel, Foster-Miller and
Magneplane, are submitting proposals for a United States model. Much of the interest in
maglev systems has been initiated at the state level with plans developed in Florida,
California, Nevada, New York, and Pennsylvania. Studies completed by the federal
government in 1993 conclude that the potential benefits of a United States maglev system
justify staring a national development program. Although there are no technical barriers
to installing a maglev system, research and development is needed to refine the technology
and determine how to reduce costs. In addition, for maglevs to become a part of the
nations transportation system, they will have to be viewed as one of the necessary parts
of an integrated transportation infrastructure, like highways and airports. For further

<p align="left">THE MAGLEV VEHICLE</p>

<p align="left">You and your partner will be constructing one maglev vehicle as a team or
you may each construct one for yourself but you do need to work together during this part
of your rotation. There are five categories that you may choose to enter. Read through
each of the categories and choose which type of vehicle you would like to construct. After
completion, you will make a video tape of your maglev vehicle test run. You may keep your
vehicle that you construct but will have to return batteries, motors, propellers etc.,
unless you supply your own materials. There is plenty of time in this module for you or
your team member to make more than one maglev model. It is suggested that you begin with
the gravity powered vehicle, test it and then construct one of the more difficult models. </p>

<p align="left">The specifications of the maglev vehicle for all categories are:<br>
Width of vehicle = 2 1/2 inches<br>
Minimum length of vehicle = 3 1/2 inches<br>
Maximum length of vehicle = 6 inches<br>
Vehicle must have a passenger compartment or body at least 3 cubic inches.<br>
The vehicle must operate free of human control or interference other than initial set-up
and release.<br>
Any materials are acceptable for construction including cardboard, paper, foam board,
plastics, balsa. Materials can be gathered from&nbsp; the resource boxes or be brought
from home. Your performance&nbsp; grade will depend on your creativity. It will be up to
you to experiment&nbsp; with a variety of materials.<br>
Vehicle must attach to the maglev test platform with tape provided by&nbsp; the teacher.
You will be allowed three test runs to acquire a time for the fastest&nbsp; vehicle.<br>

Sling shot or push vehicles are not allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
No CO-2 cartridges, compressed air, rocket engines or model airplane engines are not
allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
System must operate free of human control or interference&nbsp; other than initial set-up
and release.</p>

<p align="left">Category One: Gravity Power <br>
For this test, the vehicle must be able to traverse the 8 foot track when the track is
elevated a maximum of 24 inches on one end. Speed is not important. In this category there
is a weight limit of 100 grams or 3 1/2 ounces. You will score higher if your vehicle is
able to traverse the track at a minimum elevated height.</p>

<p align="left">Category Two: Wind Power&nbsp; For this test, the power will be provided
by a 4 inch fan. The fan will be located at the beginning of the track and stand on the
same level as the track. The track will be elevated a maximum of 5 inches on one end. You
should try to develop a vehicle that will not only traverse the 8 foot track but also do
it with the track elevated a minimum or not elevated at all. No weight restrictions apply
to this category. Operate the fan at a voltage of no greater than 4 DCV.</p>

<p align="left">Category Three: Self Contained - Balloon Power For this test, the power
will be provided by a balloon provided by the teacher. The balloon must be attached to the
vehicle and have no connections off the vehicle. The track will be elevated a minimum of 5
inches or less on one end. You should try to develop a vehicle that will not only traverse
the 8 foot track but also do it in the fastest time and with a minimum of height on one
end. No weight restrictions apply to this category. The most difficult part of this design
is developing a nozzle for the balloon. </p>

<p align="left">Category Four: Self Contained - Rubber band Power For this test, the power
will be provided by a standard rubber band provided by the teacher. The track will be
elevated approximately 5 inches or less on one end. You should try to develop a vehicle
that will not only traverse the 8 foot track but also do it in the fastest time, and with
a minimum of height on one end. No weight restrictions apply to this category. </p>

<p align="left">Category Five: Self Contained - Battery Power For this test, the power
will be provided by one to four AA batteries (6 volts) and a small motor provided by the
teacher. The track will be elevated approximately 5 inches or less on one end. You should
try to develop a vehicle that will not only traverse the 8 foot track but also do it in
the fastest time, and with a minimum of height on one end. No weight restrictions apply to
this category. The track can be elevated a minimum of height and should be noted on your
results. Category Six: Electrified Track For this test, the power will be provided by a
power supply (6 volts) that will be connected to the track. The track will be elevated
approximately 5 inches or less on one end. You should try to develop a vehicle that will
not only traverse the 8 foot track but also do it in the fastest time, and with a minimum
of height on one end. No weight restrictions apply to this category. The most difficult
part of this design is developing the connection between the vehicle and the track.</p>
