<p class="MsoNormal">Streets, malls, the front of school and neighborhood are
teeming with interesting people and faces. Capture these human artifacts as they
are found in a daily routine. A tripod, long lens or a converter, refocusing and
patience are helpful but not necessary.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Street Graphics<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Much of today's most exuberant, most creative and most telling imagery can be
found in the street. The street has become a public art gallery of visual icons,
and pictograms. Capture the images of western and rural life, neon, graffiti,
nostalgic chrome and steel. Old billboards and advertising, the chrome and steel
of vintage autos, are examples of this theme, Fill the frame, a wide angle lens
would be helpful. Be sure to bracket.</p>

 Until You Drop (the shutter)</font></o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Small shop and storefronts has become a vanishing breed.
They are falling victim to the Wal-mart and Big K type stores. Try and capture the uniqueness of a one
of a kind or family-run emporia, grocery, barber, butcher etc, a wide-angle lens
for the interior may help. Shooting after hours or in times of slow traffic
would be beneficial. Watch out for your reflections in glass.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Photograph someone working in the occupation they were
trained. Show their intensity, the sweat, the pressure, the stress, the love the
job these people do. Move in close, but not to close, one should be able to
recognize the profession they are in. Be sure you get permission first. Don’t
forget to bracket. Shoot at different angles.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666" size="6">Fill the Frame</font> <!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p><b><o:p></o:p></b>Get close and personal with your subject and fill the frame
with it. Choose a characteristic of the object that translates what the object
is without showing all of it.<br>
The red seams of a baseball, the vein in a leaf, and the tread of a tire are
good examples. Just another exercise in expanding the composition thought
process. Don't forget to bracket.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666">Ice Baby Ice</font> <!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>In no reference to ice cream. I'm talking about the fantastic compositions
that nature produces with frost and ice storms. Not great for driving in, but
it's generally not wise to operate machinery while taking pictures anyway. No
need to go further than your back yard to find amazing images. This is a great
time to use that close up lens, get close, and fill the frame with those crystal
structures of both ice and frost.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666">(No) Vacancy</font> <!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Photograph an room or space. Photograph it full or empty.&nbsp; Show the room

the room is; give me an insight to the occupants personality. A wide angle would
be help full, be
sure to bracket.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Windows<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>From picture, broken, and stained glass; there are hundreds of windows in the
world. Capture this image by filling your frame and moving in close. Look for
backlighting. Photograph an object in front or outside the window to give it
some depth.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Doorways<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>&nbsp;We pass through them everyday. Single, double, new or rustic capture 
this image by filling your frame and moving in close. Look for backlighting. 
Look for textures. Photograph an object in front or outside a door if it 
has one to give it some depth. Take a close up of the hardware; locks, chains 
hinges etc.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Protecting the Interest of Out Children.<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Feel free to interpret this theme however you like-use your imagination.
Perhaps you'd like to take a photograph of children riding their bikes while
wearing their safety helmets, or of a traffic crossing guard, guiding children
across the street. A young sibling in the back seat buckled in a seatbelt.
People do not need to be in your photo. The rubber chips beneath the monkey bars
at a local playground. A warning label on a bottle of medicine. Find a striking
image and keep your eyes open.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Images of Freedom<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Take a photography that represents what freedom means to you. A soldier in
uniform, a fourth of July celebration. There are numerous occasions a&nbsp;
photographer could capture a moment with this theme.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Curves<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>The S curve is one of the best ways to use leading lines to take the viewer
in to your photograph. Find a curve and concentrate on it in your picture. Move
in close or use a zoom, fill the frame.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Spider webs<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Spider webs are often called nature's architectural marvels. But
photographing them dramatically can be a awesome picture. If you are lucky, a
foggy early morning will bring dewy spider webs. If not create your own by using
a spray misting bottle. The dew will sparkle like jewels. A dark background will
provide a dramatic contrast. A short flash, fast shutter speed will freeze any
motion. A small aperture will insure sufficient depth of field.<br>
Be sure to bracket and shoot from a low angle, have backgrounds a distance away
so it&nbsp;&nbsp; won't reflect light.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Barns<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Take advantage of our rural surrounding. Whether they be freshly painted red,
white and green or rough and ready to fall. Barns make a interesting record of
our history and lifestyle.<br>
Make sure you shoot a perspective angle. Observe the textures both inside and
out. Be sure to bracket. Watch your horizon, choose a shot with low or a high
angle.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Looking Down<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Cracks in the sidewalk, reflections in water puddles, autumn leaves, manhole
covers with a natural high angle you can photograph objects of interest. Fill
your view finder or zoom in close. Look for textures, reflections and patterns.
Natural still life's on table settings and work benches can make some neat
moments. Be sure to bracket.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Backyard Safari<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>You don't have to trek to Africa or the Amazon to get some great natural
looking animal photos. Just go to the nearest zoo or to your own backyard and
compose carefully. The idea is to keep telltale elements out of the frame. You
can do this by choosing your camera position with care. Use a zoom lens.
Lighting is usually most attractive in early morning. Be sure to bracket.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Same Place, Different View<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>As the sun moves across the sky, and as the weather changes, a given scene
can take on quite different &quot;looks&quot;. So for this assignment, pick a
scenic spot, and watch how it changes throughout the day making a picture each
time you notice a photographic change. This will take some patience. Try
horizontal and vertical formats. Try different focal length lens. Remember, you
window of opportunity is around seven (7) minutes.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Reflections<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Reflections make great photograph subjects, and compositional elements. The
strongest reflections occur when the subject being reflected is front lit and
water surface is calm, if water is your reflecting surface. Glass, mirror,
polished aluminum are other possibilities. Be sure to bracket.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Edges<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>All objects have edges, concentrate on interesting ones. Examples could 
include, the edge of the sidewalk, an edge of broken window pane, the edge of a 
building. Move in close, try and show texture of the subject. Be sure to bracket.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">The Watermelon/The Chair<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Take a watermelon. Or any large object (like a chair). Impress me with a
photo of this watermelon. Submit a number of images as a story board. Do not
forget to bracket.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Diary of...<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Create a documentary. Show what goes on behind the scenes and the public eye.
Examples could be backstage of a student production. Beyond the gates of a
rodeo. The clean up and disarray of some event. Make sure you fill the frame. Be
sure to bracket.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Eating In<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>All images must have a food, dish, plate or platter. Or shot within a place
where food is bought, sold or consumed. Examples could be a hot dog or
concession stand. Restaurant, farmers market or even a family gathering.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Twist and Shoot<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Shoot at a longer shutter speed, but handhold the camera instead of placing
it on a tripod. Then you are free to move the camera while the shutter is open
to create long streaks , or looping swirls, instead of a normal image. Move in
close. shoot an entire roll doing this, you will have move to choose from to
finish. Works well using color film.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">&quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>The early morning hours can provide great lighting as well as the opportunity
to photograph scenes before the crowds arrive. Additionally, industrial
pollutants haven't had a chance to settle in, making scenes even clearer than
dusk. Look for items that spell out &quot;a.m&quot;. Use several exposures to
find the one that will yield good results.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">&quot;Sitting In the Evening Sun&quot;<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Like the early morning hours, a late in the day photograph can bring dramatic
light. Look for items that spell out &quot;p.m&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Grading your photographs<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your photos will be graded in six categories: Composition,
Technique, Exposure, Interest, Matting and finishing, and Your Documentation.<br>
Photo tips:&nbsp;<br>
1. Submit prints that are 5 x 7, 8 x 10 or larger. A small print tends to get
lost and is less interesting.<br>
2. Choose your assignments before submitting. Handing in multiple images of the
same subject and theme does not enhance your photographic creativity.<br>
3. Submit prints that are free of dust, scratches and finger prints, these will
only distract from the quality of your image.<br>
4. Crop your pictures carefully. Eliminate distracting portion of the image.<br>
5. Matte your pictures correctly with straight lines and borders.<br>
6. Consider the stopping power of your images. Look for subjects with good
reactions and emotions, interesting lighting, peak action, unusual and different
situations and story-telling moments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Composition: </b>The manner in which the photo is setup
and the creativity used putting together the photo. By camera handling, and by
final finishing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Technique:</b> This involves how the picture was taken,
special effects, and lenses, shutter speeds, focusing. Darkroom settings and
exposures, prints free of dust, scratches, chemical stains, and finger prints.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Exposure:</b> This involves the exposure of the photo.
Perfectly exposed pictures will score higher than poorly exposed photos.
Darkroom control including&nbsp; printing procedure, test prints, contact
prints; does
your photo have all the shades of black – gray – white?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Interest:</b> Involves how the photo catches one’s eye
and how well if fits in the theme selected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matting:</b> Involves how well the mat and photo are
finished, suitable for framing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Your Documentation:</b> Involves the information
required to duplicate your photograph. Do you know the film type, shutter speed,
and lens opening, and any other information that would be beneficial to another
photographer? Darkroom statistics... type of paper, enlarger settings, exposure
times, these need to be documented.</p>
