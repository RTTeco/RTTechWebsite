<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Photography
helps you think.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People need things outside themselves to think about, and
photography furnishes abundant food for thought. You can think about the
photographic process and never run out of things to ponder. There is something
for everyone, from very beginner to the most advanced professional. Whether you
use a point and shoot camera or a Hasselblad, there are numerous things to catch
and hold your attention.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Developing and printing also engage your thought. You can
think about the pictures you have taken. The things in the pictures, why you
shot them, how you feel about them and so on. Since nearly anything can be the
subject of a picture you have the whole world to choose from. For example,
people are the world’s most interesting problem. The things people do or might
try are almost endless. The chances of running out of things to think about and
subjects to photograph are slim. This is good for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Talking
about pictures with others</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Merely talking with others is good for you. Photography,
pictures, and photo equipment can be great subjects for conversation and help
keep the talk going. People will converse better when they can talk about
pictures since pictures can be an integral part of our lives. Usually you will
find the conversation quite intelligent and perspective. Belonging to a camera
or photography club could be good for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Discovering
your personal symbols</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your personality shows your symbols. Everything in a
photograph can be such a symbol. This includes lines, color, tones, and textures
as well as identifiable objects. The clear implication is that everything in one
of your pictures can stand for yourself. Discovering your personal symbols is a
life long quest; it is that when you get a better picture of which you are,
which is good for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Identifying
with your pictures</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A part of the symbolization process is to identify with
your pictures. Your emotional reactions while people talk about your pictures
can be a mirror of yourself. Identifying with your pictures can make you
miserable, uptight, or embarrassed. These feelings can be well worth the
self-discovery. There is nothing that is better for you than that.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Solving
problems</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As long as you can solve problems, you are in good shape.
Photography offers you an abundant amount of problems. Large or small you will
well rewarded when you solve them. Since photography consists of problems
stacked upon problems, you will never run out of things to work on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Understanding
a complex process</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Learning to understand any complex creative process is good
for both mind and emotion. It increases your feeling of substance and
completeness and proves that you are capable of handling difficult matters.
Understanding photography is difficult, and anyone who does it has good reason
to be proud of you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Revealing
yourself to others</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you show people your photographs and the personal
symbols you hold, in a sense you invite people to see who you are and how you
feel about yourself. This can be good for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Relating
to people</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although it isn’t always easy to take picture of people,
it is a good way of learning to relate to them better. Photography can serve as
the excuse for a relationship to begin. This can happen both before and after
the pictures are shot. Before you shoot, communication is important. Afterwards
you can relate imaginatively to their prints. Indeed, such pictures give you
many things to talk about.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Stimulating
your imagination</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Photography can stimulate you. Call it excitement, the
medium cannot only challenge you when you are shooting, but stimulate your
thinking during development and printing. Both your successes and your failures
will stimulate you. The later will allow you to seek improvement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Learning
to see better</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Photography is one of our primary modern tools for pursuits
such as this. It is well known that it helps you learn to see, but the seeing
goes much deeper than some people suppose. In truth, if you learn to see really
well as a photographer, you will be seeing very well indeed. This involves
seeing deeply into people, things, and events, not just perceiving what they
look like superficially. It involves an awareness of what is actually going on
in front of you as you photograph. Appearances can be very deceiving. Seeing
without this awareness is not really seeing at all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Developing
as a critic of reality</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have good mental and emotional balance, it means
that you are a good critic of reality. This means you have the ability to look
at things and see them for what they truly are, as a picture maker you learn to
criticize photographs. In doing this, you make decisions concerning the nature
of things. Which is what criticism is all about. Developing yourself as a critic
is a long and arduous process, but you improve your own health as you so do.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Developing
as a self critic</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To be a truly healthy person, you have to be a good critic
of yourself. Criticizing yourself fairly as a photographer can help you learn
this art. Good self-criticism implies self-knowledge. When you criticize a
picture into which you have projected yourself, you are criticizing yourself,
too. The important thing is to treat both your picture and yourself fairly.</p>
<p class="MsoHeader" style="tab-stops:.5in"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Becoming
more aware of things outside yourself</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the big challenges of life to be aware of the things
that is not of you. This is not easy for some people to do, for they are all
wrapped up inside themselves with no apparent possibility of escape. Photography
provides you with pictures of outside things to look at and think about. Indeed
it is hard not to think about them when they confront you from your own
pictures. Photography is mainly about tangible things that are outside. You have
to deal mentally and emotionally with outside things in order to even make a
picture. You have to be aware of them to a fairly marked degree.
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Developing
verbal linguistic skills</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You should understand that photography is a language with
all the attributes that languages have. Being able to communicate well in any
language is very healthful. Being able to speak through your camera is very good
for you. As you develop as a photographer, you learn to do this usually with
considerable skill. It is good to know that in this visual age people usually
know what your pictures are saying. Literally thousands of people develop into
effective visual communicators. Without exception they have benefited from it.
To be in good mental and emotional shape, you have to be in communication with
others and this is what they learn to do with their cameras.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Communicating
better with yourself</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a sense you can talk to your pictures and at the same
time talk to yourself, because you project yourself into your pictures.
Analyzing your work is approximately the same as analyzing yourself. In
pictures, the self becomes more visible in a way, and this leads to
communication with it. Asking yourself why you did what you did also helps in
this respect. Because of projection, all pictures are self-portraits in a way,
which means that you can see yourself clearly in your work if you look hard
enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Which is what
communications with the self is all about.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Becoming
aware of the nature of beauty</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People have a great mental and emotional need for beauty in
their lives. They also need to know what constitutes beauty. Where it comes from
and what is it made of. Photography is a pursuit of beauty. People like to be
creative. People like to look at other beautiful things others have created.
They also like to see beauty that already exists. You as a photographer will
have a chance at creating and displaying your creations.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Seeing
meaning in things</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Photographs weather they be good or bad have meaning. Any
visual communication object can be and will be interrupted differently by the
observer. Even obscure images reveal thoughts to a great many people now days.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Creating
meaning</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In photography this goes on all the time. You have taken a
picture for a reason, and this meaning can and will be shared with others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Developing
skill with the photographic medium</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you develop skill in photography, which is hard work,
will develop a sound basis for liking themselves. Skills with an art medium
produce things of value, which in turn make themselves valuable.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Broadening
your tastes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This implies a liking for many things. Photography helps
this process because you have to see well to successfully photograph them. You
will normally photograph things you like and maybe not like. We seem to have a
liking of things we understand.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Understand
light better</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing is more important to life than light itself. What
ever you have learned in science class it will be reinforced in photography. In
photography we learn to observe it closely and its effects on our subjects. As
we sharpen our photographic skills we learn to appreciate the light we receive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Expressing
yourself</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Photography is an infinitely expressive medium. Almost any
thought or mood can be expressed. To express yourself is to project yourself
into your photographs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Becoming
more aware of others</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Taking pictures of people so that they can see themselves
as images will allow them to think about themselves. The awareness of other
people can be achieved by taking these pictures. Pictures of people are nearly
as real as they are, so time spent with them is never wasted.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Developing
insight into human behavior</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can develop the insight into human behavior by looking
and studying people thru your cameras view finder.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When you reach a point where you can predict behavior, you
are doing very well.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Developing
personal power as a creator</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Holding a camera in your hands give you some personal
power. Even small creations will give you this feeling. Taking any picture at
all will do it. Making good ones is even better. You can empower people to look
at your work. You have the power to allow them to move, feel different with each
printed picture. As a photographer the camera may give you the power to change
the world.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Self
-discovery through photography</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When taking or making prints, you analyze your likes and
dislikes. Your photography can help you see around you. Although photography
deals mainly with the appearance of things, it can make you think about them on
a deeper lever.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Expand
awareness through photography</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Photography encourages you to look at things, if only to
see whether they would make good pictorial subjects. Since good subjects are
hard to find good photographers are constantly looking. Your board awareness
will keep you in good shape.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Seeing
the relatedness of things</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Real intelligence is sometimes defined as the ability to
see that all things are related. In photography we explore visible relatedness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For example, sometimes the forms of a wind blown sand dune are quite
obvious, rocks may look like potatoes, small weeds like trees, clouds like ice
cream and so on. The end point is to see that all things have a visual kinship
of some kind or other.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">·</span>Handling
a magical process</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone needs a little magic even if only to stimulate
your imagination. When that image comes out from nowhere either on film or paper
it seems like magic. You are the magician and you alone control this magical
process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In creating things we also create ourselves. As a creative
medium, photography has nearly endless dimensions, so there is something in it
for everyone. Thousands of people use to improve their lives, why shouldn’t it
work for you</p>
