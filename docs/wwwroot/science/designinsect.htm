Adaptation</b> <strong><small>From Discovery School</small></strong><br>
Insects are well designed for the habitats in which they live. Divide the class into small
groups and assign a specific habitat type to each group (e.g., salt marsh, lake,
desert, field, arctic tundra, deciduous forest, alpine meadow, human residence). Have each
group create a designer insect&#151;stressing creativity and evolution at its best. Have
each group list on paper a detailed description of its designer insect, explaining all the
adaptive features that help it to adapt well to its environment. Make sure the students
provide a scientific name (genus and species) for their insect that reflects some unique
or identifying quality of the organism. Ask students to draw their insect and present it
to the class.</p>
