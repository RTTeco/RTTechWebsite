The biology classes at Richardton High School made and sent Monarch Butterflies to Mexico
in October. They are now tracking the progress of their Monarchs and are eagerly awaiting
their arrival back to North Dakota in the spring.</font></p>

garden for signs of sprouting tulips which will hearld the beginning of spring in North
Dakota. They will be reporting their observations to <a href="http://www.learner.org/jnorth/fall1999/tulip/index.html">Journey North</a> as the

<p><a href="http://school.discovery.com/fall97/themes/bodyscience/index.html">Body Science</a></p>

<p>Body Science breaks down the parts and reveals some of the mysteries of the machine.
The amazing brain in particular is examined, both its evolution and the way it controls
our view of the world. Students will meet scientists and athletes trying to improve the<br>
body, as well as scientists who say our entire lives are programmed from birth. And two
shows on viruses--one on the science of HIV--explain how our bodies defend themselves from
constant attack, and what happens when they fail. The Discovery School site includes
activity sheets, a store where you can purchase the videos, web links and more.</p>
