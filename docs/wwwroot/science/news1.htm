    and can dunk without jumping? Who can make a whole gymnasium erupt with laughter without
    saying a word? The name Michael Cooper should come to mind. Michael Cooper came to RTHS on
    Monday, September 20 to show the student body that the arts are still very much alive. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Cooper is a mime from Maine. Cooper leaves Maine for one to two
    weeks every month to perform across the United States. He then goes back home and stays
    home for one to two weeks to make more props. He does this all year, but tries to get most
    of the summer off so he can spend some time with his family. Mr. Cooper has two sons and a
    lovely wife back home in Maine. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooper was 19 years old when he first decided to become a mime. He was
    watching T.V one afternoon and was instantly inspired. In fact, he was so inspired that he
    left college, and went off to a professional acting school in Maine. His family and
    friends thought that he was crazy, but provided much encouragement. When he finished
    school there, he decided to take his career one step further. Cooper went all of the way
    to Paris, France to a special, professional acting school. As we saw Monday in our
    gymnasium, all of these acting lessons paid off. With all of his determination, he has
    made his life a success. Although we never did ask Cooper what kind of living he makes, he
    informed us that he makes a very good one. Despite his great success as a mime, he went
    back to Maine to finish college and received his degree.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Cooper doesn&#146;t only act, he is also somewhat of an artist.
    He creates all of his own props out of papier mache, cloth, and glue. Some of his masks
    are in so much detail that they take him up to eighty hours to finish! The patience that
    this man must have, some of us will never experience. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooper encourages everyone to follow their dreams because you never
    know what might come of them. If you see a twenty foot man roaming around the area,
    don&#146;t be frightened. It is probably just Michael Cooper living his dream. </p>

    <font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the history of Richardton High
    School, we have never seen such a school wide change as the new locker situation. For
    years, according to Charlotte Zimmerman, the school secretary, the issue of alphabetized
    lockers was talked about, but only implemented with new and larger changes. It seems that
    along with the fact that alphabetization is easier for Char to record, the administration
    felt it was necessary that the separation of favorites must be made. Thus came&#133;
    alphabetized lockers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one student put it, it was okay, but felt it would lead to more
    stringent locker policies. However, for the majority of the people we spoke with, it was
    suggested that the new system is okay.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A senior, Mike Staudinger, said, &quot;Since it is the last year for us
    with the lockers, we should be by close friends. If necessary, the underclassmen can be
    alphabetized, but not seniors; (choosing who you&#146;re by) is like a senior
    privilege.&quot; In agreement with Michael, Lee Hutchinson believes that &quot;Seniors
    (should) pick out what type of lockers they use.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the perspective of a newcomer, Jenni Schank believes it is ok, but
    has a complaint with locker spacing. She would not change the situation back. However, a
    sophomore, Matt Becker, feels that the locker situation in its entirety is not the most
    intelligent thing that the administration has done. He feels that not being able to have
    same sex conversations is a violation, on the administration&#146;s part, against personal
    freedom. He also suggests that if so be, he would change his name.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to us that, for the majority of the student body, it
    doesn&#146;t appear to have a dramatic toll on their social life, and, for the most part,
    the students don&#146;t mind. Char was quoted with also saying she feels that everyone was
    cheated equally. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to everyone&#146;s question on &quot;why&quot; it was done,
    Mr. Quintus reasoned that this policy was done to make Char&#146;s work easier, as far as
    knowing &quot;who lives where&quot; when it came to lockers. Mr. Gengler boldly stated,
    &quot;Guys are okay, let&#146;s face it, but the girls seem to need to be by each other to
    live,&quot; an issue that is clearly visible here at RTHS.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>
