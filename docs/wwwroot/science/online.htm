<p><font color="#000000" size="3">This &#147;Understanding&#148; series explains how<br>
we tamed the mighty forces of electricity, magnetism and gravity,<br>
and demonstrates their impact on everyday life. You&#146;ll learn the<br>
principles that allow us to fly with the birds and to travel through<br>
space, and get a taste of what lies beyond Newton&#146;s physics: the<br>
weird, wild universe of quantum mechanics, where uncertainty rules<br>
and scientists create their own reality. The Discovery School Program includes activity
sheets, a store where you can purschase the half hour video, web links and more.</font></p>

<p>The Physics Classroom is an online physics tutorial written for high school physics
students. The coverage of topics at The Physics Classroom coincides with the coverage of
topics in the Physics 163 class at Glenbrook South High School. Each unit below is broken
up into lessons and sub-lessons. Each lesson resembles the type and extent of coverage
given to that physics topic in class. The sub-lessons are accompanied by Check Your
Understanding sections, providing an opportunity to assess your understanding of the
lesson material. </p>
