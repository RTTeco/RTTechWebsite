    may want to take the opportunity to sneak closer to the second pond, which is on your

    limiting factor to many birds in our area is a lack of good nesting sites.</p>

    <p>This stand of quaking aspen trees is uncommon for this part of the state. Something
    about this location, possibly an underground seep of water, which the trees can access,
    has allowed aspens to survive few places in southwestern North Dakota. The current
    suspension of livestock grazing is allowing for the survival of many new aspen sprouts,
    which livestock like to eat.</p>
    <p>Notice the &quot;bonsai-like&quot; or stunted aspen trees growing on the shallow soil
    on the rock. The stunted trees have very little nutrition or moisture available in the
    shallow soil. These are the limiting factors to the growth of trees on this rock shelf.</p>

    getting vital nutrients from it, and passing the concentrated sap out of their bodies,
    which the ants &quot;harvest&quot;. The ants can use this aphid &quot;honey&quot; as food.

    <p>About two-thirds of your way to marker number 7, in a sparse area, you can see a number
    of white prairie-clover plants. They are tasty and nutritious to grazing animals, and
    important to the prairie ecosystem, since white prairie-clover fixes nitrogen, or in other

    plants can use to grow more vigorously.</p>
    <p>An especially intriguing denizen or occupant of bare, dry sandy areas might be found if
    you take a few minutes and look closely. Especially good sandy areas may be found if you
    take a detour off of the trial and look below the little &quot;drop-offs&quot; on the
    sandy slope above you. If you find and odd, unexpected cone shaped depression in fine sand
    about an inch and a half deep, and two inches across, you might try dropping an ant into
    it and watching what happens. As the ant tries to climb out of the cone shaped hole, it
    will dislodge sand, which will fall to the bottom of the hole. Soon, you may see flicks of
    sand hitting the ant. Both of the ant&#146;s feet, and especially the hard flung little
    flicks of sand will disturb the sand of the cone, which is at it&#146;s &quot;angle of
    repose&quot; or limit of steepness at which it can stay without moving. When the sand is
    disturbed it will move to the bottom of the hole where an ant lion is waiting with huge
    open jaws. If the ant lion is hungry, it will grab the ant, pierce its body with fangs,
    and suck all of its bodily fluids out, and fling the empty husk of an ant out of the hole.
    Then it will flick more sand out until it is again at its angle of repose, and [Snidely
    Whiplash-like] await another victim! On the scale of an ant, it is a sad story, but it is
    the only way that the ant lion, the larvae of another insect, has found to live. Please
    don&#146;t try to dig in the hole to see what the ant lion looks like, they are fast and

    buffaloberry is a deciduous, large shrub of small tree with the branches being somewhat
    spine tipped. The fruits are eaten by birds and small animals. American Indians and
    pioneers preserved the fruits by drying. These bushes are intruding into some of the
    moister forest microenvironments, thus growing larger; yet it isn&#146;t moist enough for
    the forest species to really take advantage of the site. During several wet years, some
    forest species may be able to take advantage of the marginal forest habitat at the upper
    parts of the draw, become established, and out-compete prairie species for years to come.<p>The
    odd looking flat spot to the west is commonly called a &quot;panspot&quot;. The panspot is
    formed by the removal of the topsoil or &quot;A&quot; horizon exposing the next layer of
    soil which is commonly known as the subsoil or &quot;B&quot; horizon. The subsoil has a
    heavy accumulation of clay, giving it a high water-holding capacity. If that is the case,
    the plants should be doing wonderfully well here, shouldn&#146;t they? They do look
    healthy enough&#133;for cactus! You may ask what cactus is doing here in an area that
    should be supporting reed canary grass of other moisture loving species. It turns out that
    the subsoil has a heavy salt and sodium content. Salt increases the osmotic pressure in
    the soil, which means that it takes much more effort for the plant to draw water from the
    soil. The practical effect is that in this soil, a plant will be able to get less water
    even though the ground is wet. So the only plants that can survive are xeric plants, or
    plants adapted to dry climate.</p>

    draw allowed the water to expend all of its energy at the base of the dropoff, scouring or
    undercutting the bank, and causing the headcut to advance up the draw. As the shallower
    trail, which you saw at the last marker, heals over with vegetation, it will slow water
    flow and lessen the amount of it passing through the draw. A little soil will still slump
    down from the headcut, softening the slope. Vegetation will finally become established
