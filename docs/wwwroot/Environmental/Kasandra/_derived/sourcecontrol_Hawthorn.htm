<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="des"><b>---Description---</b></a>The Hawthorn is 
the badge of the Ogilvies and gets one of its commonest popular names from 
blooming in May. Many country villagers believe that Hawthorn flowers still bear 
the smell of the Great Plague of London. The tree was formerly regarded as 
sacred, probably from a tradition that it furnished the Crown of Thorns. The 
device of a Hawthorn bush was chosen by Henry VII because a small crown from the 
helmet of Richard III was discovered hanging on it after the battle of Bosworth, 
hence the saying, 'Cleve to thy Crown though it hangs on a bush.' The Hawthorn 
is called <i>Crataegus Oxyacantha</i> from the Greek <i>kratos</i>, meaning 
hardness (of the wood), <i>oxcus</i> (sharp), and <i>akantha</i> (a thorn). The 
German name of <i>Hagedorn</i>, meaning Hedgethorn, shows that from a very early 
period the Germans divided their land into plots by hedges; the word <i>haw</i> 
is also an old word for hedge. The name Whitethorn arises from the whiteness of 
its bark and Quickset from its growing as a quick or living hedge, in contrast 
to a paling of dead wood. </p>
<p>This familiar tree will attain a height of 30 feet and lives to a great age. 
It possesses a single seed-vessel to each blossom producing a separate fruit, 
which when ripe is a brilliant red and this is in miniature a stony apple. In 
some districts these mealy red fruits are called Pixie Pears, Cuckoo's Beads and 
Chucky Cheese. The flowers are mostly fertilized by carrion insects, the 
suggestion of decomposition in the perfume attracts those insects that lay their 
eggs and hatch out their larvae in decaying animal matter. </p>
<p><a name="con"><b>---Constituents---</b></a>In common with other members of 
the Prunus and Pyrus groups of theorder Rosaceae, the Hawthorn contains 
Amyddalin. The bark contains the alkaloid Crataegin, isolated in greyish-white 
crystals, bitter in taste, soluble in water, with difficulty in alcohol and not 
at all in ether. </p>
<p><a name="med"><b>---Medicinal Action and Uses---</b></a>Cardiac, diuretic, 
astringent, tonic. Mainly used as a cardiac tonic in organic and functional 
heart troubles. Both flowers and berries are astringent and useful in decoction 
to cure sore throats. A useful diuretic in dropsy and kidney troubles. </p>
<p><a name="pre"><b>---Preparation and dosage---</b></a>Fluid Extract of 
Berries, 10 to 15 drops. </p>
<p>The leaves have been used as an adulterant for tea. An excellent liquer is 
made from Hawthorn berries with brandy. </p>
<p>Formerly the timber, when of sufficient size, was used for making small 
articles. The root-wood was also used for making boxes and combs; the wood has a 
fine grain and takes a beautiful polish. It makes excellent fuel, making the 
hottest wood-fire known and used to be considered more desirable than Oak for 
oven-heating. Charcoal made from it has been said to melt pig-iron without the 
aid of a blast. </p>
<p>The stock is employed not only for grafting varieties of its own species, but 
also for several of the garden fruits closely allied to it, such as the medlar 
and pear. </p>
