<i>Algebra&nbsp;2</i> is made up of five instructional components: Introduction
of the New Increment, Examples with Complete Solutions, Practice of the
Increment, Daily Problem Set, and Cumulative Tests. Lesson reference numbers are
included with the Daily Problem Sets, identifying lessons students can review if
they have difficulty in solving the problems. <i>Algebra&nbsp;2</i> not only
treats topics that are traditionally covered in second-year algebra, but also
covers a considerable amount of geometry. Time is spent developing geometric
concepts and writing proof outlines. Students completing <i>Algebra&nbsp;2</i>
will have studied the equivalent of one semester of informal geometry.
Applications to subjects such as physics and chemistry, as well as real-world
problems, are also covered.</p>
<b><i>Algebra&nbsp;2</i> includes such topics as:</b>
<ul>
  <li>graphical solution of simultaneous equations
  <li>basic trigonometric functions
  <li>scientific notation
  <li>radicals
  <li>conic sections
  <li>roots of quadratic equations, including complex roots
  <li>properties of real numbers
  <li>geometric proofs
  <li>factoring
  <li>inequalities and systems of inequalities
  <li>logarithms and antilogarithms
  <li>exponential equations
  <li>algebra of polynomials
  <li>vectors
  <li>algebraic word problems
  <li>gas law
  <li>set theory
  <li>probability</li>
</ul>
