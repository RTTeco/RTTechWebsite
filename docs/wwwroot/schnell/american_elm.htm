  <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Calisto MT"> American elm, sometimes called white elm, is not only 
  the largest species of elm in this country, but also our most beautiful shade 
  tree. The drooping crown on older trees gives them an elegant, vase-shaped 
  appearance. This elm occurs commonly throughout Ohio, preferring moist, rich 
  soils, particularly along the borders of streams and in bottomlands</font></font></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Unfortunately, American elm is fast disappearing from the American scene as 
  a result of the Dutch elm disease, accidentally introduced from Europe some 
  years ago. This is a fungus disease which clogs the water-carrying vessels of 
  the tree. The disease is transmitted by the elm bark beetle. Perhaps the 
  American elm is destined to a fate similar to that of the American chestnut.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Iroquois Indians are said to have used the bark for 
  making canoes, rope, utensils, and roofing for their homes. The tough, 
  cross-grained wood is highly resistant to splitting and is used in making 
  baskets, furniture, and flooring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p><font face="Calisto MT" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Outstanding Features: </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Tolerance to urban conditions. Excellent vase shape

  <p><b><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Hardiness Zone: </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">American Elm is a large, fast growing tree with a broad 
  vase shape. It has an excellent form as a street tree. It is native throughout 
  the upper midwest and much of North America. Prior to the onset of Dutch elm 
  disease in this country, it made up a high proportion of the street tree 
  community throughout much of the United States. Leaves are medium green, 
  turning yellow in the fall. </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Calisto MT" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Requirements and Culture: </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT" color="#FFFFFF">Tolerant to a wide range of soils and climatic 
  conditions. Very tolerant of city conditions. Somewhat brittle and requires 
  some pruning to remove dead and broken branches. Preventative maintenance 
  against Dutch elm disease is recommended for valuable older specimens. </font>
  </p>
  <p><b><font face="Calisto MT" size="4" color="#FFFFFF">Limitations: </font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">The primary limitation is its susceptibility to Dutch 
  elm disease which has killed most of the old established trees in much of the 
  country. It is also susceptible to phloem necrosis and elm leaf beetle. 
  Because of these problems it is no longer recommended for landscaping. American 
  Elm has shallow roots which may damage sidewalks and drain tiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <td><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">Elm is difficult to split and work with hand tools. Machine tools are 
      more successful. Elm holds nails and screws well. Due to its muddy color, 
      it is used most often as a paint grade hardwood. The wood from American 
      elm is remarkably durable even when constantly wet. Though somewhat 
      difficult to season, once it is dried, elm has excellent steam bending 
      qualities and water-resistant properties. Texashardwood.com has seasoned 
      our Elm for two years prior to sawing and kiln drying.</font></td>

      smooth and straight grained with a finely waved pattern. It has 
      conspicuous growth rings much like ash. It is moderately hard, heavy, 
      stiff and shock resistant.</font> </td>

      <td><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Calisto MT">It is used as both lumber and veneer. It is used often for dam and 
      lock construction. Elm logs hollowed out in Roman times for use as water 
      pipes have been un-earthed in good order. In fine furniture making, elm is 
      often used for chair seats and bent parts. It is used for decorative 
      paneling; stair treads, and finished millwork in interiors. Elm is also 
      used in the manufacture of agricultural implements, boxes, barrels and 
      crates. It is also used for caskets.</font></td>
