      tall perennial herb.&nbsp; It is characterized by a creeping rootstock,
      long flat leaves, flowers in dense cylindrical terminal spikes, and brown
      cylindrical fruit with a velvety surface.</font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The plant grows in freshwater swamps, in both temperate and tropical
      climates.&nbsp; It is occasionally cultivated along water pond borders and
      in bog gardens.&nbsp; Cattails spread rapidly when water is
      plentiful.&nbsp; They, on average, grow between 1 to 2 meters high.</font></td>

<p></font><b><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">This non-native marsh weed is a wild
perennial plant that can locally be found in rice fields, around the edges of
lakes, ponds, swamps and marshes, as well as in irrigation and drainage canals.
It is troublesome because it often obstructs the flow of water and provides a
breeding habitat for mosquitoes. This European plant is also suspected to be
poisonous to horses.</font><font color="green" size="4">

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">Seven to ten feet tall, the cattail or water torch, as it has been called,
has long, broad, flat leaves. The most recognizable part of the plant, are the
female flowers, a tightly clustered cigar-shaped spike near the top of the
stalk. A smaller cluster of male flowers may be seen at the end of the spike.<br>

Typha has had many uses: the roots contain starch and have been used to make
flour. They are frequently consumed by Europeans as an asparagus-like vegetable.
The down has been used to dress wounds, stuff jackets and as a filling for
upholstery. During World War I, it was used to manufacture artificial silk, as a
substitute for cotton. Even the small seeds have been harvested as a source of
drying oil. The leaves are use in basketry.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4">On the Pacific Coast, the cattail is often called tule-reed. However, the
tule and Typha are distinctly different plants. The stem of Typha is pithy and
flattened; the leaves are strap-like. Tule has round, hollow stems and lack any
apparent leaves. The flowers of the tule are also displayed in several loose
clusters at the top of the stem while Typha flowers are tightly compacted into a
single spike.</font></b></p>
