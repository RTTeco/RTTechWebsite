badger is a bear-like animal with a stocky three foot body, short tail and short
but powerful legs that are armed with strong claws on the front feet.&nbsp; It
also walks on the soles of its feet like a bear, but the resemblance of the
beaver to the bear ends there.&nbsp; The badger is a member of the carnivore, or
flesh eater, family.&nbsp; The badger is in the family Mustelidae.&nbsp; A
characteristic of the Mustelidae family if that their foot prints show five
toes.&nbsp; This is a excellent way of distinguishing the foot prints of a
beaver from those of a dog's footprints.&nbsp; Dogs prints only show four toes.</font></p>

The American Badger bears a greater resemblance to the European Badger, but
doesn't have the black and white striped head.&nbsp; The American Badger is
widespread in North America from south-western Canada, and south to central
Mexico.</font></p>

The sett in which a badger lives in is a complex underground network of tunnels
and chambers, often with many entrances at ground level.&nbsp; The badger lines
the chambers of the sett with bedding made up of dry bracken and grass or
leaves.&nbsp; It drags out old bedding frequently and replaces it with new
bedding.&nbsp; Being a very clean animal, the badger will scoop out a toilet for
itself above ground.</font></p>

Badgers collect large amount of dry grass, straw bracken, or similar material to
line the nest chamber in their communal underground sett.&nbsp; At the end of
winter, all of it is scraped out and dumped outside the sett.&nbsp; This makes
room for new bedding to be put in place.</font></p>

badger eats a diet of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and arthropods.&nbsp; They
catch their food by digging.</font></p>
