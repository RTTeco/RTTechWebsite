<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfalfa is a herbaceous perennial
legume.&nbsp; It will re-grow year after year if it is properly cut and taken
care of.&nbsp; A mature alfalfa plant may have from 5 to 25 stems, which usually
reach a height of 15 to 25 inches.&nbsp; Stems are branched and slender and
bare.&nbsp; Leaves with more than three leaflets are not uncommon.&nbsp; Leaves
are arranged alternately on the stem.&nbsp; Spicules are slender and fused to
the petiole.&nbsp; Leaflets are linear, oblong, or obovate oblong and are
toothed toward their apices.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfalfa is worldwide in its distribution and
is grown in many areas of the US, accounting for nearly 30 million acres of
production.&nbsp; A wide range of soil and climatic conditions are suitable for
alfalfa, but for best production it requires a well-drained soil with nearly
neutral pH and good fertility.&nbsp; Alfalfa should not be expected to do well
in poorly drained or acid soil or in areas where enough water is not available.</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfalfa is used primarily as a hay
crop.&nbsp; It has the highest feeding value of all commonly grown hay crops
when harvested at late bud or early flower stage of maturity.&nbsp; Alfalfa
produces the greatest amount of protein per acre of any livestock feed.&nbsp; It
is often used in combination with corn silage in livestock rations to take
advantage of the protein and energy content of the two feeds.&nbsp; Alfalfa also
can be made in silage, pellets, meal, or cubes.&nbsp; With careful management,
alfalfa can be used as a pasture crop.</font></b> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some fun facts about alfalfa:</font></b> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-Because of its importance among forage crops, alfalfa is
referred to as the &quot;Queen of Forages.&quot;</font></b> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-The estimated value of alfalfa is $102.50 per ton.</font></b> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-Alfalfa is the fourth most widely grown crop in the United
States behind corn, wheat, and soybeans.</font></b> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-Alfalfa is beginning to be used as a bio-fuel for the
production of electricity.</font></b> </p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">-Alfalfa is even used by humans in nutritional tablets.</font></b> </p>
