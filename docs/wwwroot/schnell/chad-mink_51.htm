<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This aquatic member of the
weasel family is found throughout most of northern North America and the most
commercially valuable fur-bearer. Large males may reach a total length of 60<nobr>
</nobr>cm. As adults they are bold, ferocious, and virtually untamable, but if
they are captured as kittens they are playful and can become attached to the
person who cares for them.</font>&nbsp;<br>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mink is a skillful
hunter and preys on a wide variety of game including muskrats, meadow voles, and
cottontails, as well as fish, crayfish, and frogs. Its own principal enemies are
the great horned owl, bobcats, wolves, and coyotes.</font>&nbsp;<br>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A solitary, mainly
nocturnal animal, the mink is active throughout the year.</font>&nbsp;</p>
