fact:</font></strong><font color="#FF00FF" face="Baskerville Old Face">
Tree Swallows are the only swallows that make substantial use of vegetable food
such as seeds and berries. They favor bayberries. Eating berries when insects
aren't available helps these swallows withstand bad weather, especially during
their early spring return to the breeding range.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF">The Tree
Swallow has steel blue back with green reflections and under-parts almost a
clear or pure white, a slightly forked tail and feet the color of flesh. There
are no distinguishing marks between the male or female. This bird is 5 1/4 -
6&quot; in length with a wingspan of 12-13&quot;.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF">Male:</font></b><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF">
upperparts glossy blue-green, with long, pointed wings and notched tail;
underparts pure white; bill small, black; legs pale brown</font>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF"><b>Subadult Female:</b>
upperparts dusky grey-brown, may have flecks of blue-green throughout;
underparts pure white; bill and legs as in adult male</font>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF"><b>Adult Female:</b>
upperparts blue-green, usually less pure and glossy than in male; forehead often
brownish; underparts pure white; bill and legs as in adult male</font>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF"><b>Juvenile:</b> upperparts
dull gray-brown, with no blue-green flecks; underparts white, may have pale gray
wash on breast; bill and legs as in adult male</font>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF"><b>Nestling: </b>altricial
and downy; skin pale pink; down whitish; mouth pale yellow; gape flanges white</font></p>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF">Tree Swallows nest in a
wide variety of habitats, but prefer open grassy areas, often, but not
necessarily, near water. They take readily to using artificial nesting cavities.
With the exception of the Violet-green Swallow (<i>Tachycineta thalassina</i>),
Tree Swallows are the first swallow to return to breeding areas in the spring,
with males arriving in advance of females by about one week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF">Egg-laying is initiated
once sufficient insect prey are available for egg production by females. In the
more southern parts of the range this may be in late April, or in early to mid
May in more northern areas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Baskerville Old Face" color="#FF00FF">Winters to Honduras,
Nicaragua, and c Costa Rica. Rare cowbird host. Forestry practice of removing
standing dead trees has greatly reduced availability of natural nest sites; will
use nest boxes.</font></p>
