<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5"><strong>Description:</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Kochia is an annual forb growing from 2-5 feet tall and begins growth in late
spring. The stems of kochia are erect, much-branched and leafy. Leaves are
arranged alternately on the stems, which become bright red with age. Interest in
the plant as a feed source has been high in recent years exhibiting crude
protein levels of 12 to 25 percent. Kochia can produce the same amount of forage
per acre as alfalfa with half the water; hence, the plant is often called
&quot;poor man's alfalfa&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5"><strong>Distribution and Habitat:</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Kochia is an annual plant originating in Eurasia, and introduced into America
in the early 1900's. Its appearance was first recorded in Texas during the late
1940's. It is found throughout most of the United States and occurs locally on
disturbed sites and in old fields.</font></p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5"><strong>Toxic Agent:</strong></font><p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">The plant contains a number of agents which could contribute to its toxicity.
These are oxalates, alkaloids, saponins, nitrate, and sulfate. Oxalate poisoning
by kochia involves a mineral imbalance caused when calcium becomes bound by
oxalates. Calcium levels drop in the blood and this results in sudden death.
There may be liver damage in some animals which results in photosensitization.
In other cases there may be polioencephalomalacia which could be due to the high
sulfate.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5"><strong>Livestock Symptoms:</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">There are several symptoms characteristic of kochia poisoning depending on
the toxic principle. Some general symptoms include:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">nervousness or confusion
  </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">incoordination </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">muscular spasms </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">blindness </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">a tendency to lie down </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">sudden death</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Potential syndromes from kochia poisonings include (see Descriptions of
Animal Conditions for specific symptoms):</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">polioencephalomalacia </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">oxalate poisoning </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">photosensitization </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">liver damage </font>
  <li><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">nitrate poisoning</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="5"><strong>Integrated Management Strategies:</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Two treatments have been used with varying degrees of success to counteract
oxalate poisoning from kochia. One of these is an intravenous injection of
calcium gluconate, while the other is dicalcium phosphate fed free choice at 25
percent of the usual salt ration. The latter treatment is often used as a
preventive measure when cattle or sheep are grazing pastures heavily infested
with kochia. Caution must be used when cattle grazing kochia are allowed access
to water containing high amounts of salt. Some ranchers have had success feeding
free choice hay straw to their animals to reduce toxicity problems. In cases of
polio, treat affected animals with vitamin B (thiamine).</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tempus Sans ITC">Due to the annual growth habit, mechanical or chemical control treatments are
effective when desired but are generally not warranted. It is generally
recommended that cattle should not graze kochia for longer than approximately 60
days. Kochia can be considered a valuable forage in some circumstances.</font></p>
