<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Geography – Range</b><br>
<br>
Throughout the entire western United States, including the four deserts of the
American Southwest<br>
<br>
<b>Related Species</b><br>
<br>
There are 2 major subspecies: the Mule Deer, with tail white above, tipped with
black; and the Black-tailed Deer, with tail black or brown above.<br>
<br>
The Cervidae Family includes deer and their allies, including moose, elk, and
caribou. Member of this family occupy a wide range of habitats, from arctic
tundras to tropical forests, and can be found over most of the world. All have
slender legs. Most are brown or gray in color, with white spots characterizing
the young, and in a few species, the adults. In all but one genus of cervids, at
least the males have antlers.<br>
<br>
<b>Comparisons</b><br>
<br>
The Mule Deer, while closely related to the eastern species-the white-tailed
deer, are remarkably distinct in their biological, ecological, and behavioral
attributes.<br>
<br>
The Mule Deer carries its thin, black-tipped tail drooped, unlike the uplifted,
bushy white tail of its cousin. They have a distinctly different gait from the
leisurely, graceful leaps of the white-tail. When startled, a Mule Deer will
move in a series of stiff-legged jumps with all four feet hitting the ground
together.<br>
<br>
Mule Deer are usually a dark gray-brown, with a small white rump patch and a
small, black-tipped tail. Their large ears are distinctive. White-tail deer are
tan in color, with a larger tail.<br>
<br>
Mule Deer antlers are normally smaller and branch to form 2 equal forks, while
the male White-tailed Deer has forward curving antlers with a number of points
(tines) branching from the main beam.<br>
<br>
<b>Description</b><br>
<br>
<img src="du_muledeer2.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="235" height="149">Mule Deer have large ears
that move constantly and independently, from whence they get their name,
&quot;Mule&quot; or &quot;Burro Deer.&quot; They do not run as other deer, but
have a peculiar and distinctive bounding leap (stotting) over distances up to 8
yards, with all 4 feet coming down together. In this fashion, they can reach a
speed of 45 m.p.h. for short periods.<br>
<br>
This stocky deer with sturdy legs is 4 to 6-1/2 feet in length and 3 to 3-1/2
feet high at the shoulder. During the summer, the coat on its upper body is
yellow- or reddish-brown, while in winter more gray. The throat patch, rump
patch, inside ears and inside legs are white with lower portions running cream
to tan. A dark V-shaped mark, extending from a point between the eyes upward and
laterally is characteristic of all Mule Deer but is more conspicuous in males.<br>
<br>
Males are larger than females. The bucks' antlers, which start growth in spring
and are shed around December each year, are high and branch forward, forking
equally into 2 tines with a spread up to 4 feet.<br>
<br>
The Mule Deer is slower and less colorful than the White-tailed Deer, but its
pastel, gray-buff color provides a physical adaptation to the desert environment
which disguises it from predators like the Cougar, the Coyote and the eagle who
will swoop down on a fawn.<br>
<br>
Mule Deer have no canine teeth and, like the cow, have a multi-part stomach, the
first two chambers of which act as temporary storage bins. Food stored here can
be digested later when the deer chews its cud.<br>
<br>
<b>Vocalization</b><br>
<br>
Deer are not especially vocal, although young fawns bleat on occasion. Injured
deer utter a startlingly loud &quot;blatt&quot; or bawl.<br>
<br>
<b>Tail</b><br>
<br>
The tail is usually tipped in black with a white basal portion, and its under
parts are white.<br>
<br>
<b>Ears</b><br>
<br>
The Mule Deer large ear is gray on the outside and white on the inside.<br>
<br>
<b>Feet</b><br>
<br>
Another physical adaptation, its larger feet, allows the Mule Deer to claw out
water as much as two feet deep, which it detects with its keen sense of smell.<br>
<br>
<b>Behavior</b><br>
<br>
Seasonal movements involving migrations from higher elevations (summer ranges)
to lower winter ranges are associated, in part, with decreasing temperatures,
severe snowstorms, and snow depths that reduce mobility and food supply. Deep
snows ultimately limit useable range to a fraction of the total. Mule Deer in
the arid southwest may migrate in response to rainfall patterns.<br>
<br>
When startled, a Mule Deer will move in a series of stiff-legged jumps with all
four feet hitting the ground together. This gait offers two advantages: it
allows the deer to out-distance predators in rough terrain, and to see above the
thick brush. If necessary, they can turn or completely reverse direction in the
course of a single bound.<br>
<br>
Mule Deer are active primarily in mornings, evenings and moonlit nights. This
inactivity during the heat of the day is a behavioral adaptation to the desert
environment that conserves water and keeps the body temperature within livable
limits. Sweat glands and panting also provide evaporative cooling during hot
periods.<br>
<br>
During the middle of the day, the Mule Deer beds down in a cool, secluded place.
The mature buck seems to prefer rocky ridges for bedding grounds, while the doe
and fawn is more likely to bed down in the open.<br>
<br>
<b>Habitat</b><br>
<br>
Mule Deer moves between various zones from the forest edges at higher elevations
to the desert floor, depending on the season. While the Mule Deer occupies
almost all types of habitat within its range, it seems to prefer arid, open
areas and rocky hillsides.<br>
<br>
<b>Food &amp; Hunting</b><br>
<br>
Food of the Mule Deer is quite varied. In Spring and Summer it feeds on green
leaves, herbs, weeds and grasses more than on browse species. The reverse is
true in Fall and Winter.<br>
<br>
Mule Deer are browsers and eat a great variety of vegetable matter, including
fresh green leaves, twigs, lower branches of trees, and various grasses. They
are particularly fond of blackberry and raspberry vines, grapes, mistletoe,
mushrooms and ferns. They eat so carefully they can even consume the fruit of
cactus.<br>
<br>
<b>Breeding</b><br>
<br>
The mating season for Mule Deer reaches its peak in November and December, as
antlered stags round up females and fight for their possession. Antlers are shed
after the breeding season, from mid-January to about mid-April. Most mature
bucks in good condition have lost theirs by the end of February; immature bucks
generally lose them a little later. Males and females mix freely while traveling
together in groups during winter months, often down to the desert floor.<br>
<br>
Dominance is largely a function of size, with the largest males, which possess
the largest antlers, performing most of the copulations<br>
<br>
Mule Deer breed in late November and early December. A buck will find a suitable
doe and</font><img src="du_muledeer.jpg" align="right" width="283" height="220"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
they will often play chase games at breakneck speeds before mating. They will
remain together for several days.<br>
<br>
When antlers start growing again in the spring, the group breaks up. The females
go off by themselves and eventually give birth and nurse their young; the males
wander in friendly twosomes or small bands throughout the summer months as
antlers grow.<br>
<br>
From April through June, after about a 200-day gestation period, the doe
delivers 1 to 4 young (normally 2). Fawns are born in late May or early June. A
doe will usually produce a single fawn the first year she gives birth and then
produce twins in following years. The fawn, colored reddish with white spots,
weighs about 6 pounds at birth. It must nurse within the first hour and stand
within the first 12 hours. During early weeks of life, the fawn sees its mother
only at mealtimes for feeding. Spots begin to fade by the end of the first
month.. They have white camouflage spots and are further protected by having
little or no scent. Fawns usually stay with the doe for the first full year.<br>
<b><br>
Conservation</b><br>
<br>
Life span in the wild is 10 years, but Mule Deer have lived up to 25 years in
captivity .<br>
<br>
All federal, state, and provincial land and wildlife management agencies
recognize the fundamental need to maintain Mule Deer ranges and keep them
habitable. To counter the trend of agricultural development, rangeland
conversion, mining, road and highway construction, and the development of
housing tracts, many states and provinces have purchased critical areas,
especially winter ranges, to maintain the various habitats of Mule Deer. But,
due to political opposition to government acquisition of privately owned lands,
plus a scarcity of funds for this purpose, only a small fraction of Mule Deer
ranges has been acquired by the government.<br>
<br>
<b>Cautions</b><br>
<br>
There is some competition between the Mute Deer and the livestock on the range,
especially in Spring and early Summer. Also, Hoof and Mouth Disease and other
diseases can be transmitted from the Deer to the livestock and vice versa..<br>
<br>
Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine are of major economic importance for commercial
timber. However, these trees are browsed heavily by O. hemionus. Browsing of
other trees is seldom considered an economic problem. This situation invites
browsing of sufficient intensity to influence forest regeneration in many areas<br>
<br>
Mule Deer is a target for various viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases. For
example, heavy amounts of gastrointestinal nematodes may cause death in Mule
Deer. This parasitic disease is usually indicative of such predisposing factors
as high Mule Deer density and malnutrition.<br>

          <br>
          Mule Deer is an excellent swimmer, but water is rarely used as a means
          of escaping predators.<br>
          <br>
          The annual cycle of antler growth in Mule Deer is initiated and
          controlled by changes in day length acting on several cell types of
          the anterior pituitary.<br>
          <br>
          While unable to detect motionless objects, Mule Deer is
          extraordinarily sensitive to moving objects.</font>
          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Mule Deer sense of hearing is
          also extremely acute.<br>
          <br>
          For Native Americans and early European settlers, deer meat (venison)
          provided one of the most important sources of protein.<br>
          <br>
          Sport hunters kill about 1 million Mule Deer and 2 million
          White-tailed Deer annually.<br>
          <br>
          Deer hides were used to make buckskin jackets, moccasins and other
          leather articles.<br>
