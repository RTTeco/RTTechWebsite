<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Showcard Gothic">The skunk prefers open areas of
mixed forests and grasslands and has very little fear of humans, so it has
benefited from the new habitats created by the opening of the forests that
accompanied settlement and agriculture.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Showcard Gothic"> They generally live in the
abandoned dens of woodchucks, foxes, or other mammals their size or larger and
only occasionally excavate their own dens.&nbsp; Rock piles, stumps, or refuse
heaps can also be used.</font></p>
<p><font face="Showcard Gothic" color="#000080" size="5">Food</font></p>
<p><font face="Showcard Gothic" color="#000000" size="3">THey eat insects, mice,
shrews, ground squirrels, young rabbits, birds' eggs, and various plants.&nbsp;
THey eat mainly insects in the summer.&nbsp; THey are especially fond of
grasshoppers, crickets, and insect larvae such as white grubs, army worms, and
cutworms.</font></p>
