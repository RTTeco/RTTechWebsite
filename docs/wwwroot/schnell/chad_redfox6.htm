<p>Red foxes are one of Canada's most widespread mammals, found in all provinces
and territories. There are probably more red foxes in North America now than
there were when Europeans began to arrive in the 16th century. Scientists
believe that the range and numbers of the red fox expanded at that time because
the pioneers created additional habitat for these small mammals by thinning the
dense forests and killing many of the wolves that had kept fox numbers down.</p>

<p>Foxes belong to the same family, the Canidae, as domestic dogs, coyotes, and
grey wolves. Taxonomists once thought that the North American red fox was a
different species from the smaller fox of southern Europe. It is now known,
however, that they both belong to the same species <i>Vulpes vulpes</i>. The
range of <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> is continuous across Europe, Asia, and North
America, and the species is expanding its range in North Africa and Australia,
where it was introduced a century ago by British fox hunters.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The red fox is a small, dog-like mammal, with a sharp pointed face and ears,
an agile and lightly built body, a coat of lustrous long fur, and a large bushy
tail. Male foxes are slightly larger than females. Sizes vary somewhat between
individuals and geographic locations -- those in the north tend to be bigger.
Adult foxes weigh between 3.6 and 6.8&nbsp;kg and range in length between 90 and
112&nbsp;cm, of which about one-third is tail.</p>
<p>Although &quot;red fox&quot; is the accepted common name for the species, not
all members of the species are actually red. <i>Vulpes vulpes</i> has a number
of common colour variations, two or more of which may occur within a single
litter. The basic, and most common, colour is red in a variety of shades, with a
faint darker red line running along the back and forming a cross from shoulder
to shoulder on the saddle. Individuals commonly exhibit some or all of the
following markings: black paws, black behind the ears, a faint black muzzle,
white or light undersides and throat, a white tail tip, and white stockings.
Other common colours are brown and black. Red foxes that are browner and darker
than most of their species and have a cross on the saddle that is dark and
prominent are sometimes referred to as &quot;cross foxes.&quot; Red foxes that
are basically black with white-tipped guard hairs in varied amounts are known
colloquially as &quot;silver foxes.&quot; Silver foxes are particularly valued
by the fur trade, and large numbers were selectively bred in captivity during
the heyday of fox fur as popular apparel.</p>
<p>Red foxes have been called bold, cunning, and deceitful, particularly in
children's stories. In fact, they are shy, secretive, and nervous by
disposition, and they appear to be very intelligent. They have a sharp bark,
used when startled and to warn other foxes.</p>
<h3>Food and hunting</h3>
<p>Probably red foxes eat more small mammals -- voles, mice, lemmings,
squirrels, hares, rabbits -- than any other food, although they supplement this
with a wide variety of other foods, including plants. Their diet changes with
the seasons: they may eat mainly small mammals in fall and winter, augmented in
spring with nesting waterfowl, especially on the prairies, and in summer with
insects and berries. They have been seen feasting on eggs and chicks of colonies
of nesting seabirds, and will take other birds, and their nestlings and eggs,
when they can get them. Red foxes have been known to eat and feed to their young
lake trout weighing 1.5– 3&nbsp;kg, which they caught by leaping from the
shore onto fish schooling in shallow water. They eat a wide variety of other
items, including seal pups, beaver, reptiles, fruits of all sorts, and garbage.
They will frequently bury or hide surplus food for later use, but other animals
often find and use it first.</p>
<p>Foxes have a bad reputation as chicken thieves, and they will in fact invade
poultry yards when it is safe and easy to do so. On farmlands, however, they
more than compensate for the odd chicken by eating vast numbers of
crop-destroying small mammals and insects, and they are now usually appreciated
by farmers.</p>
<p>Red foxes hunt by smell, sight, and sound, as do most dogs. They have
excellent eyesight, and the slight movement of an ear may be all that they need
to locate a hidden rabbit. They have a keen sense of smell and acute hearing.
They can smell nests of young rabbits or eggs hidden by long grass. Sometimes
they wait patiently for the sound of a mouse moving along its path in grass or
snow and then pounce; at other times, hearing movement underground, they dig
quickly and locate the prey by its scent. They hunt mostly toward sunset, during
the night, and in early morning.</p>
