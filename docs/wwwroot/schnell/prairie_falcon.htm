<p><font color="#FF6600">A swift and agile flyer, the Prairie Falcon ranges
widely over plains, desert, open mountains, and canyons. Paler than its close
relative, the Peregrine, the Prairie has the cheek marks and pointed wings and
the sharp, curved talons and beak of the falcon family. (The name <i>falcon </i>comes
from the Latin word <i><b>falx </b></i>which means &quot;sickle&quot;, referring
to the shape of the talons and beak.)</font>
<p><font color="#FF6600">Often flying low to the ground to catch rodents and
small birds, this bird can dive from heights at very high speeds, and because of
its lighter body, fly even faster than the Peregrine.</font>
<p><font color="#FF6600">While the Peregrine Falcon was severely affected in the
past by the accumulating metallic poisons in the food-chain, derived from eating
water fowl and causing egg-shell thinning, the Prairie has shown some of this
effect from eating Horned Larks that have fed on newly-planted seeds which are
treated with poison. A more direct adverse effect of agricultural activity is
the reduction of habitat, especially hunting grounds.</font>
<p><font color="#FF6600">In several falcons, including the Prairie Falcon the
female is about 1/3 larger than the male. This is thought to be a way of
reducing competition for food, especially in bird-hunting raptors - hence the
males feed on smaller species of prey while the larger females go for bigger
birds.</font>
<p><font color="#FF6600">Prairie falcons nest in crevices or on ledges of
cliffs; 4-5 eggs are laid and young are cared for after they have learned to
fly.</font></p>
