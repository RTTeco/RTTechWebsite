<font color="#009900">Other common names include: Red Twig Dogwood, Western
Dogwood, American Dogwood, Redstem Dogwood, Red Dogwood,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinnikinnik,
Squawbush, Creek Dogwood, California Dogwood,&nbsp; Red-stemmed Cornel, Redbrush,
Gutter Tree, Red Willow, <i>harts rouges</i>, Poison Dogwood, Shoemack, Waxberry
Cornel, Dogberry Tree, Redosier Dogwood.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">A deciduous, many-stemmed shrub 3'-19' tall.</font></p>
<font color="#009900"><b>Leaves </b>opposite with prominent lateral veins that
curve toward the tip and smooth edges.</font>
<p><font color="#009900"><b>Stems</b> and twigs dark red when young, gradually
fading to grey-green, becoming red again in the fall and winter.</font>
<p><font color="#009900"><b>Flowers</b> small and white, borne in a flat-topped
cluster and, unlike many dogwoods, there are no large, showy bracts.</font>
<p><font color="#009900"><b>Fruits </b>berrylike, white or lead colored at
maturity.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Tolerates extremely cold temperatures (laboratory
temperatures as low as -320º F). Avoids freezing injury caused by ice forming
within living protoplasm by having freezable water frozen extracellularly. The
factors that seem to affect cold acclimation the most are low temperatures,
short days, water stress, and the developmental stage of the plant. Far red
light, characteristic of the long twilights at high latitudes, and short day
length promote cold acclimation. Water-stressed plants have an increased
tolerance of freezing and increase their freezing point. In plants exposed to
short days, tissue changes occur that reduce the plant's ability to take up
water and simultaneously increase water loss so that the plant partially
dehydrates even when water is plentiful.</font></p>
<font color="#009900">A characteristic species of swamps, low meadows, and
riparian zones; also found in forest openings, open forest understories, and
along forest margins.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Southern limits appear to be determined by high
temperatures.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Prefers rich, moist soils with pH range of 5.5 to 7.0.
High levels of mineral nutrients needed for vigorous growth.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Tolerates flooding and, consequently, is found on
floodplains and wetlands and is often one of the first shrubs to invade wet
meadows.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Seeds germinate above water level, but after several
years growth, the plants can live with the roots submerged in water for most of
the growing season. Plants on such wet sites are found in mineral rich swamps or
fens and not in nutrient poor sphagnum bogs.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">An early to mid successional species that is supressed
in shade and is not normally found in the understory of closed canopy forests.
It is found in the understory of mixed open forests.</font>
<p><font color="#009900">Needs moderate to full sunlight. Its natural occurrence
in full sunlight may be facilitated by its growth in wet situations where it
encounters no water stress.</font>
