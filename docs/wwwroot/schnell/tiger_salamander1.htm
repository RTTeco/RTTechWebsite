<p align="left"><font color="#FF0066">The Tiger Salamander in British Columbia
has large blotches of yellow or dirty white on a black, grey or dark brown
background. The borders of the blotches are often indistinct or they might join
in such a way as to form a zebra-like pattern. The blotches extend down the
sides and are not confined to the back nor do they ever form a distinct dorsal
stripe. The belly is dirty grey while the legs and tail are mottled with light
and dark patches.</font></p>

The salamander has widespread but fragmented distribution across Canada with
three <b><a href="http://rbcm1.rbcm.gov.bc.ca/end_species/es_gloss/es_gloss.html">subspecies</a></b>
being recognized in parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba
and possibly Ontario. In the U.S.A., it occurs in the western states south to
Wyoming and Nebraska and south down through eastern Mexico.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0066">Tiger Salamanders inhabit the dry southern interior of
the province and are usually found near small, frequently <b><a href="http://rbcm1.rbcm.gov.bc.ca/end_species/es_gloss/es_gloss.html">alkali</a></b>,
lakes and ponds. They resist periods of drought by residing below ground. During
the summer they hide below ground in abandoned mammal burrows or in other
hollows in rotting logs or other <b><a href="http://rbcm1.rbcm.gov.bc.ca/end_species/es_gloss/es_gloss.html">subterranean</a></b>
hibernating sites (perhaps rocky areas). Generally, they are active near the
surface only at night during or just after spring or fall rains or during their
breeding migration in early spring or migration after metamorphosis. Otherwise,
the adults are rarely seen.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0066">They also choose breeding sites that are adjacent to
grassland foraging habitat with access to suitable alkaline lakes and ponds with
prey availability.</font></p>
