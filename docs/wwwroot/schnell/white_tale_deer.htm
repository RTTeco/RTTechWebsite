  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Virginia, or white-tailed, deer, <i>Odocoileus virginianus,</i>
  is found throughout North and Central America, where it winters in conifer
  swamps and summers at the outer edges of forests, and as far south as Bolivia,
  where it divides its time between river valleys and higher ground. It has also
  been introduced in New Zealand and parts of Scandinavia. White-tailed deer
  have a reddish summer coat that fades to gray-brown in the colder months. The
  white patches on its underside give the animal its name.</p>
