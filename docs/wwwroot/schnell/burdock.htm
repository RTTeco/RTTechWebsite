<p align="left"><font color="#800080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burdock is a stout
plant with large, wavy leaves and round heads of purple flowers.&nbsp; It is
enclosed in a globular involucre of long stiff scales with hooked tips, these
scales are often interwoven with a white, cottony substance.&nbsp; It is a dull,
pale green, the stem about 3 to 4 feet and branched, rising from a biennial
root.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800080"> It will grow in any soil,
but the roots are formed best in a light well-drained soil.&nbsp; The seeds
germinate readily and may be sown directly in the field, either in autumn or
early spring, in drills 18 inches to 3 feet apart, sowing 1 inch deep in autumn,
but less in spring.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800080"> The dried root from plants
of the first year's growth forms the official drug, but the leaves and fruits
are also used.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800080"> It is a great blood
purifier.&nbsp; In all skin diseases, it is a certain remedy and has effected a
cure in many cases of eczema, either taken alone or combined with other
remedies, such as Yellow Dock and Sarsaparilla.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800080"> An infusion of the leaves is
useful to impart strength and tone to the stomach, for some forms of
long-standing indigestion.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800080"> When applied externally as a
poultice, the leaves are highly resolvent for tumors and gouty swellings, and
relieve bruises and inflamed surfaces generally.&nbsp; The bruised leaves have
been applied by the peasantry in many countries as cataplasms to the feet and as
a remedy for hysterical disorders.</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#800080"> From the seeds, both a
medicinal tincture and a fluid extract are prepared, of benefit in chronic skin
diseases.&nbsp; Americans use the seeds only, considering them more efficacious
and prompt in their action than the other parts of the plant.</font></p>
