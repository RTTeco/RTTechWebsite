    <td width="100%"><font color="#FFFFFF"><i>Pronounced As</i>: <b>alfalf or
      lucern loosûn</b> , perennial leguminous plant (<i>Medicago sativa</i>)
      of the family Leguminosae (pulse family), the most important pasture and
      hay plant in North America, also grown extensively in Argentina, S Europe,
      and Asia. Probably native to Persia, it was introduced to the United
      States by Spanish colonists. Of high yield, high protein content, and such
      prolific growth that it acts as an effective weed control, alfalfa is also
      valued in crop rotation and for soil improvement because of the
      nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its nodules. The several varieties of the
      species grow well in most temperate regions except those with acid soil or
      poor drainage. The alfalfa belt of the United States centers chiefly in
      the northern and western parts of the country. Young alfalfa shoots have
      been used as food for humans and have antiscorbutic properties. Carotene
      and chlorophyll for commercial use are extracted from the leaves. Alfalfa
      is also called medic, the name for any plant of the genus <i>Medicago</i>-Old
      World herbs with blue or yellow flowers similar to those of the related
      clovers. Black medic (<i>M. lupulina</i>) and the bur clovers (<i>M.
      arabica</i> and <i>M. hispida</i>) are among the annual species
      naturalized as weeds in North America and sometimes also grown for hay and
      pasture. Alfalfa is classified in the division <a href="http://encyclopedia.com/articles/29159.html"><u>Magnoliophyta</u></a>,
      class Magnoliopsida, order Rosales, family Leguminosae.<br>
