<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet clover (<i>Melilotus officinalis</i>) is a 
biennial plant that grows to heights of 2 to 4 ft (0.6-1.2 m) and produces small 
yellow flowers emitting a fragrance resembling that of hay or vanilla. It is a 
member of the legume family. During its first year of growth, most of its energy 
goes into developing its root system. In the second year it flowers between May 
and September, sets its seeds, and dies. Its seeds may remain viable for over 30 
years. The plant is also called hart's tree, hay flower, king's clover, melilot, 
sweet lucerne, or wild laburnum. Sweet clover grows in North America, Europe, 
Australia, and the temperate regions of Asia. In the early 1900s, sweet clover 
was grown for forage and to build up the soil, since its roots help to keep 
nitrogen in the soil. Today it is used to support honey production. In some 
agricultural areas of the United States, however, sweet clover is now considered 
a nuisance because it spreads rapidly and can take over open fields or prairies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet clover is valued for its medical uses because 
the flower contains coumarinic acids. Coumarin is the active ingredient in 
prescription blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants).&nbsp; Its presence in 
sweet clover allows it to reduce inflammation and swelling by increasing the 
flow of blood between the heart and the veins. As an herbal remedy, sweet clover 
is used in the treatment of

have been confirmed in tests conducted on animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken internally as a tea or as a tisane, sweet 
clover relieves discomfort in the legs, particularly night cramps,

the traditional medical treatments of vein inflammation,

Applied externally as a poultice, sweet clover speeds the healing of bruises and 
eases the swelling of hemorrhoids</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale of herbal products is not regulated in the 
United States. They are sold as dietary supplements without proof of safety or a 
standard of quality control. In addition, the lack of comprehensive scientific 
research leaves the consumer without a standard to follow. Therefore, persons 
interested in using sweet clover or any other herbal remedy should always 
consult a physician or pharmacist before beginning a program of herbal therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-term ingestion of high doses of sweet clover 
can cause

<font color="#000000">headache</font></a> and stupor. In isolated cases, 
temporary liver damage can result. These side effects go away when the treatment 
is stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although sweet clover does not have any identified 
interactions, prescription drugs containing coumarin have been known to interact 
adversely with other prescription drugs, especially blood thinners, aspirin, and 
heart medications. Persons taking prescription drugs of any type should check 
with their physicians before begining a regimen of sweet clover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coumarin can also cause birth defects and bleeding 
in the fetus. Therefore, the use of sweet clover should be avoided during
