<p align="left"><b><font size="5">Description:</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="3">The beaver is the largest rodent in North
America.&nbsp; They are non migratory and live by water year round.&nbsp;
Beavers are relatively short and squat, with a large rump.&nbsp; Each foot has
five toes, with the hind feet being webbed to help the beaver groom.&nbsp;
Beavers have small, short ears and have been known to stand using their hind
feet only.&nbsp; Typically the tail is used to help balance the beaver while
they perform this maneuver.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="5">Habitat:</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Beavers are almost entirely aquatic.&nbsp; While
beavers are most home in water, they are quite capable of traveling on land, and
do so regularly to reach nearby trees.&nbsp; Beavers are slow and awkward on
land though, and are not able to move as gracefully.&nbsp; A single pond will
consist of a family group living in burrows in stream banks or in lodges of mud,
stones, and tree branches.&nbsp; These lodges are built by the beavers
themselves.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="5">Food:</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Despite the large front teeth of the beaver,
these animals are herbivores.&nbsp; They eat plants only.&nbsp; Most commonly
they eat the bark of certain hardwoods such as poplar, aspen, birch, cherry,
willow, maple, and alder.&nbsp; Aspen and pond weeds are their favorite natural
foods.&nbsp; Among domesticated beavers, or beavers that have been raised by
humans, they have been known to eat a number of fruits such as apples.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="5">Reproduction:</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">Beavers are monogamous but if one mate dies, the
other will &quot;remarry&quot;.&nbsp; Family groups consist of two adults,
several two year olds, and the young of the current year.&nbsp; They mate first
at about three years old.&nbsp; Gestation is 128 days.&nbsp; Litters of 2 to 6
are born in April and May.&nbsp; Kits can swim when they are a few hours old,
and are weaned at one month.&nbsp; The mother carries the kits in her mouth
supported on her front legs while walking upright on her hind legs and
tail.&nbsp; Young leave or are forced out of the colony in two years.&nbsp;
Large lodges may have several family songs.&nbsp; Family life is cooperative.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="5">Fun Facts:</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">-Beavers can cut down trees with up to 30 inch
diameters.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">-In 1800, the beaver was extinct east of the
Mississippi.&nbsp; In some places the beaver has re-established itself to
nuisance proportions.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">-They can cut trees down faster than some grown
men.&nbsp; (8&quot; diameter in 5 minutes)</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font size="3">-Beavers can hold their breath for 20
minutes.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
