<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">REPRODUCTION</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Barn swallows often mate in the air.&nbsp; Both 
parents build the nest.&nbsp; Nests are made of mud and lined with grass and 
feathers.&nbsp; The cup-shaped nest is built&nbsp; under a rock ledge or in the rafters or 
eaves of buildings.&nbsp; The female lays four to six eggs.&nbsp; Both parents help 
incubate the eggs and care for the young.&nbsp; The eggs take around two weeks to 
hatch and the chicks will fledge when they are about three weeks old.&nbsp; The 
female may have two broods a year.&nbsp;</font> </p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">BEHAVIOR</font></p>
<p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Barn swallows are Neotropical migrants.&nbsp; They 
travel by day, eating as they fly.&nbsp; They can even feed their young while they 
are in flight! They can travel as many as 600 miles a day.&nbsp; Barn swallows 
migrate in large groups.</font> </p>
