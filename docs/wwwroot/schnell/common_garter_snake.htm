    Generally, you can recognize this most common of all New England snakes by 
    its pattern of yellow stripes on a black or brown background. Although the 
    pattern is variable, it usually consists of a narrow stripe down the middle 
    of the back and a broad stripe on each side. Between the center and each 
    side stripe are two rows of alternating black spots. A dark line separating 
    the yellow side stripe from the belly is not particularly bold as it is in 
    the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/umext/nrec/snake_pit/pages/eribbon.html">
    ribbon snake.</a> Background color is usually brown or black, but may be 
    somewhat green or reddish. Stripes may be tan, yellow or orange. A garter 
    snake will occasionally appear more checkered than striped. The scales are

    keeled</a> and the belly is yellow or pale green. </span></font>
    <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><span class="secondbody">Garter snakes 
    generally mate after emerging from hibernation in March or April. Females 
    give birth to 12-40 young anytime from July through October. </span></font>

    <p><font face="Bookman Old Style"><span class="secondbody">Garter snakes 
    occupy a variety of habitats including pond and stream edges, wetlands, 
    forests, fields, rocky hillsides and residential areas. They are often 
    observed as they bask on rocks, wood piles, stone walls, hedges and swimming 
    pool decks. Although they feed on a variety of small animals, garter snakes' 
    primary prey are earthworms and amphibians. Their saliva appears to be toxic 
    to amphibians and other small animals and a bite may produce swelling or a 
    burning rash in some people. Although garter snakes may or may not bite if 
    handled, most individuals secrete a foul-smelling fluid from anal glands 
    when alarmed. Occasionally, garter snakes make their way into basements, a 
    situation that appears to be most common in spring or autumn. </span></font>
