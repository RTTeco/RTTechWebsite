      cactus represent about a dozen species of the <b>Opuntia</b> genus (<b>Family
      Cactaceae</b>) in the North American deserts. All have flat, fleshy <b>pads</b>
      that look like large leaves. The pads are actually modified branches or
      stems that serve several functions -- water storage, photosynthesis and
      flower production. <b>Chollas</b> are also members of the Opuntia genus
      but have cylindrical, <b>jointed stems</b> rather than flat pads.</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like other cactus, most prickly pears and
      chollas have large spines -- actually modified leaves -- growing from <b>tubercles</b>
      -- small, wart-like projections -- on their stems. But members of the
      Opuntia genus are unique because of their their clusters of fine, tiny,
      barbed spines called <b>glochids</b>. Found just above the cluster of
      regular spines, glochids are yellow or red in color and detach easily from
      the pads. Glochids are often difficult to see and more difficult to
      remove, once lodged in the skin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fruits of most prickly pears are
      edible and sold in stores under the name &quot;<b>tuna</b>.&quot; Prickly
      pear branches (the pads) are also cooked and eaten as a vegetable. They,
      too, are sold in stores under the name &quot;<b>Nopalito</b>.&quot;
      Because of the glochids, great care is required when harvesting or
      preparing prickly pear cactus.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Verdana" size="3">Range &amp; Habitat</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Prickly pear cactus are found in all of
      the deserts of the American Southwest, with different species having
      adapted to different locale and elevation ranges. Most require course,
      well-drained soil in dry, rocky flats or slopes. But some prefer mountain
      pinyon/juniper forests, while others require steep, rocky slopes in
      mountain foothills.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Verdana" size="3">Description<img src="prpear2.jpg" align="right" naturalsizeflag="3" width="158" height="199"></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most prickly pear cactus have yellow, red
      or purple flowers, even among the same species. They vary in height from
      less than a foot (Plains, Hedgehog, Tuberous) to 6 or 7 feet (Texas, Santa
      Rita, Pancake). Pads can vary in width, length, shape and color. The
      Beavertail, Santa Rita and Blind Pear are regarded as spineless, but all
      have glochids.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to the North American native
      prickly pear cactus listed below, there are many varieties, non-native
      imports and hybrids, so identification can often be difficult. Information
      on the 15 species below is based on wild, non-cultivated samples.</font></p>
