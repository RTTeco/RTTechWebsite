    herbs throughout history. In ancient times when they only has herbs and 
    spices for medicinal purposes, it was said that the healing powers of sage 
    come directly from the Virgin Mary. <br>

    grows to three feet tall and requires lots of sunlight.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sage is originally from the Mediterranean region.
      It was a part of early trade and became widely used because of its
      exceptional healing effects. There is no part of this plant that can not
      be used. The leaves, flowers and stems all have healing attributes.&nbsp;<br>
