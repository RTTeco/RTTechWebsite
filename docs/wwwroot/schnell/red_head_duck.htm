<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Voice: </b></font>You will definitely hear 
this bird before you see it.&nbsp; These birds are ground nesters and will feign 
injury to draw predators away from their nest.&nbsp; They are prevalent on golf 
courses and&nbsp; anywhere there is an open field.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Reproduction: </b></font>The parent killdeer 
start sitting on the eggs to incubate them as soon as all the eggs have been 
laid. The killdeer embryos inside the first-laid three eggs do not start 
developing while the eggs are sitting out in the cold. But when they feel the 
warmth of the parent killdeer, all four killdeer embryos start developing at the 
same time.&nbsp; So even though the first-laid egg spends a longer time in the shell 
than the last-laid, all the killdeer chicks have the same development period. It 
takes 24 to 28 days of incubating for the chicks to hatch.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Fun Facts:</b></font><font face="Verdana Ref" color="#000000" size="3">&nbsp; 
Throughout North America, south to central Mexico, the West Indies, and the 
Pacific coast of South America. It is a hardy bird, wintering in much of its 
breeding range. The killdeer is about 23 to 28 cm (about 9 to 11 in) long, brown 
above and white below, with two black bands traversing its breast. It is a 
powerful flier and rapid runner. The preferred breeding habitat is fields, 
pastures, and freshwater shores, and even grassy vacant land within city limits. 
The nest is a shallow depression in the ground. The four eggs are pointed and 
heavily marked with dark brown and black against a cream or buff background 
color.</font></p>
