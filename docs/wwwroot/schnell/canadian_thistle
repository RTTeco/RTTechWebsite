<p><b><i><font size="+1">What is a Perennial Weed?</font></i></b>
<p>A perennial weed is any weed capable of surviving for three or more years
Perennial weeds are characterized by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative
reproduction in these species is due to (a) rhizomes-underground creeping stems
commonly found in perennial grasses; (b) stolons-prostrate stems or runners on
the soil surface with roots at the nodes; (c) creeping roots; (d)
tubers-underground enlarged storage stems; or (e) bulbs-underground storage
organs consisting of a stem axis covered with many overlapping leaf scales.
<p>Perennial weeds may or may not reproduce by seed. They always, however, have
the potential to reproduce by vegetative means.
<p><b><i><font size="+1">Description of&nbsp;<a name="3"></a>Canada Thistle</font></i></b>
<p>Canada thistle has an extensive, deep root system. Stems are 2 to 5 feet
tall, grooved, and branch only at the top. Stems are slightly hairy when young,
but increase in hairiness with maturity. Leaves are slender, smooth, and have
crinkled edges with spiny margins. There are many compact rose-purple flowers
surrounded by tight bracts. Flowers are about 3/4 inch in diameter. Seeds are
brown, smooth-coated, 3/16 inch long, and attached to a tannish down that is
easily broken off. Canada thistle primarily spreads by an underground root
system. It often grows in dense patches in fields or pastures.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b><i><font size="+1">Methods of Control</font></i></b>
<p>Methods of perennial weed control fall into three categories: (a) cultural,
such as crop rotation; (b) mechanical, tillage including various implements such
as plows, disks, or cultivators; and (c) chemical, using herbicides. Control of
perennial weeds may require a combination of all these methods. Consider the
energy and environmental implications when choosing a method of control.
<p><b><i><font size="+1">Mechanical Control</font></i></b>
<p>Mechanical control may increase or decrease perennial weed infestations.
Tillage may increase infestations by moving perennial weeds to new areas of the
field or breaking dormancy of underground buds resulting in new shoot growth.
Tillage during cool, wet conditions results in reduced control.
<p>Tillage may decrease perennial weed infestations if done frequently enough to
deplete underground root reserves. The field should be tilled every two or three
weeks. Warm, dry soil conditions increase the effectiveness of tillage for
perennial weed control by drying plant roots on the soil surface.</p>
