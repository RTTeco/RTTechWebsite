      common sunflowers is a native of Mexico and Peru, introduced into this
      country in the sixteenth century and now one of our most familiar garden
      plants.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an annual herb, with a rough, hairy stem, 3
      to 12 feet high, broad, coarsely toothed, rough leaves, 3 to 12 inches
      long, and circular heads of flowers, 3 to 6 inches wide in wild specimens
      and often a foot or more in cultivation. The flower-heads are composed of
      many small tubular flowers arranged compactly on a flattish disk.<br>
      </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial Black">They are tall,
      hardy, annual or perennial herbs. Most are which are grown in gardens,
      being of easy cultivation in moderately good soil, and that useful plant
      of the kitchen garden.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The genus <i>Helianthus, </i>being derived from <i>helios</i>
      (the sun) and <i>anthos</i> (a flower), has the same meaning as the
      English name Sunflower, which it is popularly supposed has been given
      these flowers from a supposition that they follow the sun by day, always
      turning toward its direct rays.&nbsp; Every part of the sunflower may be
      utilized for some economic purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The<u> leaves </u>form
      a cattle-food and the <u>stems</u> contain fiber which may be used
      successfully in making paper. The <u>seed</u> is rich in oil, which is
      said to approach more nearly to olive oil than any other vegetable oil
      known. The <u>flowers</u> contain yellow dye.&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The oil can be used in candle and soap making. 
    The residue after the oil is expressed forms an important cattle-food. This 
    oil-cake is relished by sheep, pigs, pigeons, rabbits, and poultry. The 
    seeds make excellent chicken feed and feeding fowls on bruised Sunflower 
    seeds is well known to increase their laying power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also roast sunflower seeds for snacks too.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>
