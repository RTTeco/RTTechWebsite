      Snake is a hissing constrictor from North America. This snake is also
      called the gopher snake in western North America and the pine snake in
      eastern North America. It is a constrictor, a snake that kills by
      squeezing prey until the victim can no longer breathe. The Bull Snake
      makes a hissing noise because of this noise, people sometimes mistake it
      for a rattlesnake.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bull Snakes are up to about 5 feet long. They
      range from yellow brown to to brown to cream colored, with black and brown
      markings, the belly is light brown. This snake has a small head and a
      large shield, which it uses to dig. Like all snakes, Bull Snakes are
      cold-blooded, they are the same temperature as the environment. The Bull
      Snake smells using its tongue.&nbsp; This snake has teeth and can bite,
      but its not venomous.&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bull Snakes are carnivores. Like all snakes, they
      swallow the prey whole, head first. The snake's top and&nbsp; bottom jaws
      are attached to each other with ligaments, which let the snake to swallow
      animals that are wider than itself. Snakes don't chew their food, they
      digest it with very strong acids in the snake's stomach. Bull Snakes eat
      burrowing mammals (like mice, rabbits, gophers, and ground squirrels),
      ground nesting birds, and bird eggs. After eating a large animal, the Bull
      Snake needs no food for a long time, and it rests for weeks. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enemies of the Bull Snake include hawks and
      eagles. The Bull Snake lives in the North America, in sandy areas,
      prairies, open forests, agricultural fields, and brush.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bull Snakes mate in the spring. Females dig a
      shallow, sandy burrow and lay 3 to 20 cream-colored eggs in a clutch. The
      incubation period is about 64 to 80 days. Newborn are from 1 to 1 1/2 foot
      long. There is no parental care of the young. </font>
