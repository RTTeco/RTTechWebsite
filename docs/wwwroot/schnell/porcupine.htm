    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font size="4">The North American Porcupine is
      a well protected, plant eating rodent that spends most of its time in
      trees, looking for food. These slow moving animals have sharp, needle like
      quills protecting their body. Porcupines live up to 20 years in captivity.
      They live in forests, deserts, and grasslands in much of North America.
      Their predators include the cougar, coyote, and bobcat.&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rodent usually weighs around 22 pounds. Its
      blunt-nosed face has small eyes, and small, round ears. The legs are
      powerful with long curved claws making it slow footed and strong. The
      front half of the body is covered in long guard hairs which are yellowish
      color in the west and black or brown in the east. The rump and tail are
      covered in over 30,000 quills which are 1-2 inches in length and set with
      tiny scale like barbs. The quills are mainly used for defense
      purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North American Porcupine are herbivores who eat
      leaves, bark, evergreen needles, buds, twigs, fruit, and salt. Common
      porcupines are also known to gnaw on bones and antlers from the ground due
      to their high mineral content.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reproduction occurs in the fall or early winter.
      After&nbsp; mating, the female repels the male and a copulation plug is
      formed. The gestation period lasts between 205 and 217 days with the young
      being born from April to June. Litters normally consist of single
      offspring. Offspring are born with their eyes wide open. The mothers
      remain with their young for up to six months .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common porcupine is primarily found in
      coniferous forests but are also frequently found in deciduous of mixed
      forests.</font> <br>
