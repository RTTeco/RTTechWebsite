<font size="4" face="Times New Roman" color="#0000FF">Prickly pear cactus represent about a
dozen species of the Opuntia genus (Family Cactaceae) in the North American 
deserts. All have flat, fleshy pads that look like large leaves. The pads are 
actually modified branches or stems that serve several functions -- water 
storage, photosynthesis and flower production. Chollas are also members of the 
Opuntia genus but have cylindrical, jointed stems rather than flat pads.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like other cactus, most prickly pears and chollas have large 
spines -- actually modified leaves -- growing from tubercles -- small, wart-like 
projections -- on their stems. But members of the Opuntia genus are unique 
because of their their clusters of fine, tiny, barbed spines called glochids. 
Found just above the cluster of regular spines, glochids are yellow or red in 
color and detach easily from the pads. Glochids are often difficult to see and 
more difficult to remove, once lodged in the skin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fruits of most prickly pears are edible and sold in 
stores under the name &quot;tuna.&quot; Prickly pear branches (the pads) are also cooked 
and eaten as a vegetable. They, too, are sold in stores under the name &quot;Nopalito.&quot; 
Because of the glochids, great care is required when harvesting or preparing 
prickly pear cactus.<br>
<br>
<u>Range &amp; Habitat</u><br>
Prickly pear cactus are found in all of the deserts of the American Southwest, 
with different species having adapted to different locale and elevation ranges. 
Most require course, well-drained soil in dry, rocky flats or slopes. But some 
prefer mountain pinyon/juniper forests, while others require steep, rocky slopes 
in mountain foothills.<br>
<br>
<u>Description</u><br>
Most prickly pear cactus have yellow, red or purple flowers, even among the same 
species. They vary in height from less than a foot (Plains, Hedgehog, Tuberous) 
to 6 or 7 feet (Texas, Santa Rita, Pancake). Pads can vary in width, length, 
shape and color. The Beavertail, Santa Rita and Blind Pear are regarded as 
spineless, but all have glochids.<br>
<br>
In addition to the North American native prickly pear cactus listed below, there 
are many varieties, non-native imports and hybrids, so identification can often 
be difficult. Information on the 15 species below is based on wild, 
non-cultivated samples.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Though it's correct that cacti are about 90% water, it's a 
myth that you can simply insert a spigot into a cactus and then fill your 
canteen. A glue-like liquid can be obtained if you mash and press the pulp of 
all fleshy cacti. However, the easiest way to obtain water from cactus is to 
simply peel the fruits or young pads and eat them raw.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The pads, fruits, seeds, and flowers of the prickly pear are 
all edible and can be prepared in a variety of ways.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The pads and fruits are covered with spines and, at the base 
of each spine, numerous hairlike glochids. Be careful when you collect and clean 
the pads and fruits, since these small glochids can cause considerable 
irritation for several days once they're in your skin. Collect the pads or fruit 
with thick gloves, or with a piece of canvas or brown paper. The spines and 
glochids are then removed either by peeling the skin, or by burning them off.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">When collecting pads, choose the young, glossy green ones. The 
older ones are fibrous and tough. Prepare the young pads by peeling their skin, 
dicing, and adding them to salads. The flavor is reminiscent of sour green 
peppers.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The peeled pads can also be sliced thin (like green beans) and 
boiled. The first water is poured off if you want to reduce the sliminess. Then, 
once cooked in the second water, you can season with butter, garlic powder, and 
serve. The peeled and sliced green pads can also be dried, and then 
reconstituted later for various recipes. These dried cactus slices - commonly 
known as &quot;leather britches&quot; - are used in soups and stews in much the way you'd 
use string beans.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">On a &quot;Wild Food Outing&quot; I was conducting, we found wild husk 
tomatoes, prickly pear, and curly dock leaves. We collected and cleaned an equal 
amount of all three, and sauteed it in a cast iron skillet over our small fire. 
With no additional seasoning, this was a delicious, flavorful, and well-balanced 
dish.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
<img height="152" src="prickly2.jpg" width="229" align="left" border="0">Omelettes 
are commonly made with the young prickly pear pads. Peel and dice, and cook in a 
skillet until the water starts to come out of the cactus. The bright green 
cactus will change to a dull green - almost tan - as it cooks. Add diced onions 
and the eggs, and serve when ready. Prickly pear cactus is commonly served this 
way in omelettes throughout the entire southwestern United States. Huevos 
rancheros con nopalitos, for example, is ranch-style eggs with cactus.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">You'll discover that diced prickly pear pads will help to 
thicken soup and stew stock as does okra. The peeled pads can also be baked like 
squash or pickled. Also, it has long been believed in Mexico that eating the 
prickly pear pads helps diabetics. Researchers are now verifying the value of 
this cactus. Among other things, it helps the pancreas to produce insulin.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The fruit is edible raw, with a flavor reminiscent of 
watermelon, but with a more granular texture. The fruit is full of tiny seeds 
which can be chewed and eaten, swallowed whole, or spit out. Many Indians would 
dry the seeds, and grind them into a type of pastry flour.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">These fruits ripen in late summer. Use the prickly pears to 
make drinks, pies, jam, jellies, and other dessert items. I've even made prickly 
pear ice cream during one of my wild food cooking classes. We peeled the fruits 
and mashed the red seedy fruit, not bothering to strain out the seed. The mashed 
fruit was put into an electric ice cream maker with milk (no sugar was added). 
The resultant ice cream was excellent!</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">The seeds, thus saved, can be dried and ground into flour. The 
flour can be used alone, or mixed half and half with other flours for bread, 
pancakes, or other pastry products.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
<img height="145" src="prickly4.jpg" width="218" align="left" border="0">Prickly 
pear juice is also easy to make. Press the peeled fruit through a colander to 
remove the seed. Add an equal amount of water to this sweet, pulpy mass and 
serve chilled.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Artists can make a dye from the fresh red fruits, or by 
squeezing the small cochineal beetles (Dac-tyopius coccus) that hide within a 
white fuzz on many of the cactus pads.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Cactus pads can also be used as a hair rinse and conditioner. 
Take small chunks of the peeled pads, add them to a container of water, and 
agitate. Strain out the cactus and keep the mucilaginous liquid. This liquid 
should be massaged into the hair, and then rinsed, resulting in silkier hair.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Prickly pear cactus is an easy-to-grow, drought resistant 
plant for your yard or homestead. Just plant the individual pads and they'll 
grow. The plants thrive in sunny regions, though most can't tolerate snow and 
frost, and will die in extremely wet environments.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">Prickly pear planted around the perimeter of your yard 
provides a steady supply of food, and serves as a natural fence through which 
most animal and human intruders won't penetrate. Also, I've witnessed these 
border patches of cactus stop the spread of grass fires, though the fire causes 
some temporary damage to the cactus.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">These cactus with their yellow, purple, or red fruits are 
synonymous with the arid Southwest. Because of their many uses, the prickly pear 
cactus is worthy of a home in all the backyards and homesteads within its 
growing climate. </font></p>
