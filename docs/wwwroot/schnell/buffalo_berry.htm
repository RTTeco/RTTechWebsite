      <p align="center"><font face="Bookman Old Style">This plant can be considered either a large 
    shrub or a small tree.&nbsp; It can tolerate poor sites and is extremely 
    hardy.&nbsp; The limbs of the shrub are thorny, and it produces a scarlet 
    fruit.&nbsp; These berries that are created can be used in jellies or jams 
    and can be dried or eaten raw.&nbsp; They seem to have a tart taste, but 
    after a frost, they tend to sweeten a bit.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Bookman Old Style">The plant is dioecious, which means a single 
    plant will bear only male or female flowers.&nbsp; Male plants have dense 
    clusters of rounded flower buds, and the female plants have fewer buds that 
    are smaller, flatter, and more slender.&nbsp; The male plants are needed for 
    pollination, and the females are the only ones to produce the fruit.&nbsp; 
    It is said that for each four to five female plants, one male plant is 
    needed.</font></p>
