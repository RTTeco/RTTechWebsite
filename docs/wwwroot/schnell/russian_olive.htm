      <p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Russian olive can outcompete
      native vegetation.&nbsp; It's capable of fixing nitrogen in its roots;
      therefore, it can grow on bare, mineral substrates and dominate riparian
      vegetation.&nbsp; The Russian-olive provides a plentiful source of edible
      fruits for birds.&nbsp; These are a small cherry-like drupe that is eaten
      by many species of birds.</font></td>
