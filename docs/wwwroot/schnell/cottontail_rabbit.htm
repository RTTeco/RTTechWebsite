<p></center>Cottontail rabbits are abundant in the Historical Triangle and are
great favorites of children. They are small brown animals with white tails that
resemble powder puffs. Long ears, big eyes and great speed on a getaway are
attributes that often save the little fellow in brushes with hawks, owls,
snakes, foxes and other predators. Many rabbits are killed by hunters in season;
a great number find death under the wheels of speeding autos. Despite all this
destruction, rabbits continue to thrive because of the many litters that are
born each year.
<p>The food of rabbits consists of grass, tree bark and many kinds of vegetables
taken from gardens. In some areas, it is impossible to raise string beans
without protection of wire fencing. As clover is a favorite rabbit food,
gardeners with small plots of ground often circle the planted area with clover
to protect their crops of vegetables from the ravages of Peter and Molly
Cottontail.
<p>Cottontails are prone to many diseases, the most notable being tularemia.
Cooking the meat thoroughly eliminates the germ, making the food safe for human
consumption. To prevent infection, hunters who kill rabbits for food should wear
rubber gloves when skinning and dressing the animals</p>
