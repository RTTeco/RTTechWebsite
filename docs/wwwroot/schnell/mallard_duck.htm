    <td width="50%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duck is the common name for wild
      and domestic waterfowl of the family Anatidae, which also includes geese
      and swans. It is hunted and bred for its meat, eggs, and feathers.
      Strictly speaking, duck refers to the female and drake to the male. Ducks
      are usually divided into three groups: the surface-feeding ducks-such as
      the mallard, wood duck, black duck, and teal-which frequent ponds,
      marshes, and other quiet waters; the diving ducks-such as the canvasback,
      scaup, scoter, eider, and redhead-found on bays, rivers, and lakes; and
      the fish-eating ducks, the mergansers, with slender, serrated bills, which
      also prefer open water. The surface feeders take wing straight up, while
      the divers patter along the water's surface in taking off. Ducks make long
      migratory flights. At the time of the postnuptial molt, the power of
      flight is temporarily lost, and most of the Northern Hemisphere drakes
      assume &quot;eclipse plumage similar to that of the female. The ancestor
      of all domestic breeds, except the Muscovy of South American origin, is
      the mallard, <i>Anas boscas,</i> which is found in Europe, Asia, and North
      America. In the mallard drake a white ring separates the bright-green head
      and neck from the chestnut breast, the back is grayish brown, the tail
      white, and the wings have blue patches. The wood duck, <i>Aix sponsa,</i>
      smaller than the mallard, nests in hollow trees; the drake is a
      varicolored, iridescent ornament to lakes and ponds. The blue-winged,
      green-winged, and European teals are small ducks that fly with great
      speed. The canvasback, <i>Fuligula vallisneria,</i> is hunted widely for
      its palatable flesh. It has a chestnut head and neck, black bill and
      chest, and whitish back and underparts. A swift flier, it is also an
      expert swimmer and diver. It breeds from the Dakotas and Minnesota north
      and winters on the coastal waters along the entire continent. In northern
      countries a portion of the down with which the eider ducks line their
      nests is systematically collected, as are some of the eggs; since the
      eiders lay throughout the season, these are soon replaced. The mergansers,
      genus <i>Mergus,</i> also called sheldrakes or sawbills, are usually
      crested. They include the goosander and the smaller red-breasted
      merganser, both circumpolar in distribution, and the North American hooded
      merganser, similar to the Old World smew. Because their fish diet gives
      their flesh a rank taste, they are called by sportsmen &quot;trash ducks.
      Ducks are classified in the phylum <a href="http://encyclopedia.com/articles/36370.html"><font color="#FFFFFF">Chordata</font></a>,
      subphylum Vertebrata, class Aves, order Anseriformes, family Anatidae.<br>
