&quot;Russian thistle&quot; and &quot;wind witch&quot; are common names for this
symbol of the American west. Russian thistle alludes to its Eurasian origin.
Scientific names for tumbleweed include Salsola kali, S. pestifer, S. australis,
S. iberica, and S. tragus. Salsola is derived from the Latin sallere, &quot;to
salt,&quot; in reference to the plant’s salt tolerance. There does not yet
appear to be a consensus on the preferred scientific name, although S. tragus is
the leading candidate for the inland variety of tumbleweed and S. kali, for the
more coastal variety.</span></p>

<b>Description</b><br>
<br>
Virtually everyone recognizes mature the Russian thistle, which looks like the
skeleton of a normal shrub. Plants may be as small as a soccer ball or as large
as a Volkswagen beetle. Most people, however, would fail to recognize the
seedling and juvenile plant’s bright green, succulent, grass-like shoots,
which are usually red or purple striped. Inconspicuous green flowers grow at
axils (where leaf branches off of stem) of the upper leaves, each one
accompanied by a pair of spiny bracts. Mice, bighorn sheep</span><img src="russia4.jpg" align="left" v:shapes="_x0000_s1026" width="270" height="231"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
and pronghorn eat the tender shoots.<br>
<br>
<b>Habits/Habitats</b><br>
<br>
As it rolls down a desert road, a Russian thistle plants do what they do best,
disperse seeds, which typically number 250,000 per plant. Seeds are unusual in
that they lack any protective coat or stored food reserves. Instead, each seed
is a coiled, embryonic plant wrapped in a thin membrane. To survive winter
without a warm coat, the plant does not germinate until warm weather arrives.<br>
<br>
When moisture falls, the plant is ready to uncoil and germinate. All that is
required are temperatures between 28 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit. It then quickly
sends up two needle-like leaves and begins to shoot skyward. By autumn the plant
has reached maximum size, flowered and begun to dry out. A specialized layer of
cells in the stem facilitates the easy break between plant and root, and the
journey begins anew.<br>
<br>
Like many invasive weeds, Russian thistle exploited the destruction of native
ecosystems. When farmers removed prairie grasses, they created a perfect
environment, smooth and flat, for a plant that could roll across the landscape
dispersing seeds. Herbicides now control the spread of Russian thistle by
disrupting the maturation process of the plant.<br>
<br>
<b>Range</b><br>
<br>
Although tumbleweed is native to the arid steppes of the Ural Mountains in
Russia, it is now ubiquitous throughout the western states, growing in disturbed
soils such as agricultural fields, irrigation canals and roadside shoulders and
ditches. Plants thrive in salty and alkaline soils but will generally be
outcompeted by natives in undisturbed habitats. Elevation range is from below
sea level in Death Valley to over 8500 feet.<br>
<br>
Tumbleweeds were first reported in the United States around 1877 in Bon Homme
County, South Dakota, apparently transported in flax seed imported by Ukrainian
farmers. Within two decades it had tumbled into a dozen states, and by 1900, it
had reached the Pacific Coast.<br>
<br>
The peregrinating (highly traveled) plant also grows abundantly in Afghanistan,
Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Greece, Hawaii, Hungary,
Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, Norway,
Pakistan, Poland, South Africa and Turkey.<br>
<br>
Notes<br>
The Sons of Pioneers made the song Tumbling Tumbleweeds popular in the 1940’s.
They did not, however, write the song, which first appeared as a poem in a
University of Arizona literary quarterly.<br>
<br>
A severe drought in the 1930’s in Canada led farmers to use young tumbleweeds
as hay and silage for livestock.</span></p>

L. subsp. <i>iberica</i> Sennen &amp; Pau ] Annual, reproducing only by seed. A
very bushy, much-branched, spiny plant 5 - 120 cm (2 in. - 4 ft) high, its
diameter often exceeding its height; <b>stems</b> green, usually striped with
red lines, and rough with short, firm hair; <b>cotyledons</b> (seed leaves) very
narrow and grass-like, gradually lengthening and reaching 3 - 5 cm (1 - 2 in.)
long; first true <b>leaves</b> apparently opposite (2 per node), as long as or
longer than the cotyledons, needle-like. round or slightly flattened in
cross-section, softly sharp-pointed; later leaves gradually shorter but mostly
alternate (1 per node); young plants often with crowded erect leaves and
resembling a grass; older plants with firm, short, bract-like leaves, usually
only 6 mm (¼ in.) long, with a broad base tapering to a slender point and
ending in a hard, sharp spine; <b>flowers</b> small, lacking petals but with 5
pinkish to greenish-white, membranous winged <b>sepals,</b> stalkless in the
axle of each cluster of 3 spine-tipped bract-like leaves. At maturity, the
brittle stem breaks at the top of the root and the whole plant is rolled and
tumbled by the wind, dropping seeds with each bounce and turn. <b>Seeds</b>
cone- or top-shaped, the broader end flattened or hollowed and with a small
point in the centre, about 2 mm (1/12 in.) across and the same long; the coiled
embryo being visible through the nearly transparent seed coat. Flowers from July
to August.</p>
<p>Russian thistle occurs throughout Ontario, usually in coarse soils along
roadsides, railroads, waste areas, and occasionally in pastures and fields on
sandy soils.</p>
<p>It is distinguished from most other plants by its spininess and nearly
spherical shape and from other so-called &quot;tumbleweeds&quot; by the long,
thin, needle-like leaves of the young plant, and by the short, bract-like leaves
and extremely spiny nature of the older plant.</p>
