<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Identification:  The muskrat is a large, stout,
semi-aquatic rodent. Its head is broad and blunt with short ears barely visible
beyond the fur. The muskrat's coat is practically waterproof and is soft, dense,
and grayish brown in color. The under fur is covered by long, brown guard hairs
which serve to protect the soft under hair from wear. Its tail is scaled, nearly
hairless, and somewhat flattened on the sides. The muskrat is further adapted
for its semi-aquatic life with lips that act as valves, closing behind the front
incisors so it can actually gnaw underwater.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Range: The muskrat is found throughout the United States except in the
predominantly dry areas. It is common in New England and throughout Connecticut.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Reproduction: Muskrats have a high reproductive rate, producing up to
four litters per year each with six to seven young. They are polygamous and
breeding takes place from late March through July. After a gestation period of
28 to 30 days, the young are born blind, helpless, and almost naked. In two
weeks, their eyes open and in approximately eight weeks they are weaned from
their mother.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">History in Connecticut: Muskrat populations appear to be cyclical in
nature and influenced by the availability of food. Muskrats eat a variety of
food, though, and usually are able to maintain high population levels. They have
a high reproductive potential and have always been widely distributed and
abundant in Connecticut. Native Americans and early settlers utilized muskrats
as a source of food and fur but had little influence on population levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Interesting Facts: Muskrats live in or near water most of their
lives. They make their homes in bank dens or lodges similar to those of the
beaver but smaller in size. Muskrats excavate dens by burrowing into the banks
of slow-moving streams with their sharp front claws. The dens are complete with
dry chambers and underwater tunnels, and there are ventilation holes which are
hidden at the surface by shrubs, branches, and thick vegetation. The lodges,
constructed with aquatic plants, brush and mud, are usually situated on a
foundation of brush or a stump or are occasionally built up from the bottom of
the wetland. Several small feeding huts that are similar to, but less complex
than the lodges, may be constructed within the muskrat's territory. Here the
animal will periodically feed while protected from predators and harsh weather.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Muskrats are active throughout the year and, although mainly nocturnal, are
sometimes seen during the day. They are susceptible to cold and wind and spend
more time in their dens during the winter. Although several may share a lodge
during the winter. Muskrats are highly territorial and aggressive toward each
other. In fact, a female may kill newly-weaned young in an effort to drive them
away before the arrival of a new litter. The muskrat's normal home range is
usually within 200 yards of its den, although it may travel several miles over
land in search of suitable habitat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">With their webbed hind feet acting as paddles and their tail as a rudder,
muskrats swim at a speed up to 3 miles per hour and can even swim backwards. The
muskrat can give a warning slap with its tail, similar to the beaver, and remain
submerged for as long as 15 minutes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Muskrats may modify wetland habitat making it more attractive to a wide
variety of wildlife. However, high populations of muskrats can eliminate too
much aquatic vegetation making the habitat less suitable to some species. The
muskrat leads all North American wild furbearers in the number of animals caught
and total pelt value.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Managing Property Damage: Sometimes muskrats can be considered a
nuisance to the landowner if they are damaging a garden or crop by their feeding
and burrowing activities. Planting beyond the animal's normal 200-yard home
range or enclosing the garden and/or field with fencing can effectively solve
these muskrat problems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) occurs throughout most of
Alaska's mainland except some islands of Southeast Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula
west of Ugashik Lakes, and the Arctic Slope north of the Brooks Range. The
highest populations of muskrat are in the broad floodplains and deltas of major
rivers and in marshy areas dotted with small lakes.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Muskrats are one of Alaska's most visible and numerous furbearers; but harsh
winters, dry summers, and overpopulation result in periodic fluctuations in
numbers. Four-fifths of the muskrats harvested in Alaska are taken in five
areas: the Yukon Flats surrounding Fort Yukon, Minto Flats, Northway-Tetlin
Flats, the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta, and the Selawik-Kobuk-Noatak area.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">General description: Sometimes mistaken at first glance for the
beaver, the muskrat's small size and rat-like tail are the most immediate
identification marks. Muskrats weigh from 2 to 4 pounds (0.9-1.8 kg). They
measure 10-14 inches (26-36 cm) in length, excluding their 8-11 inch (20-28 cm)
tails. Their coats consist of soft, dense underfur and long, coarse, shining
guard hairs. The guard hairs produce the dominant color of the upper parts.
Coloration ranges from a medium silvery brown to dark brown with a lighter
belly. The feet and tail are dark brown or black. In open, swampy areas muskrats
construct houses of vegetation piled into mounds 2 to 3 feet above the surface
of the water and 5 to 6 feet in diameter. They also tunnel into earth banks.
Their nests are well above high water and have tunnels exiting underwater below
the lowest freezing level. Muskrats construct slides and make fairly
well-defined channels through vegetation along banks of streams and ponds.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Life history: Muskrats have both a high reproductive and population
turnover rate. Mature females usually have two litters per year and annually
give birth to 15 young, or 7 to 8 per litter. Mating begins as soon as there is
open water in the spring. In Interior Alaska this date may range from late April
to mid-May, and the young resulting from this first mating are born in early to
mid-June. Females mate again three to five days after the first litter. Their
second litter is born about 25 days later. Thus there are two peaks in breeding
activity separated by about 30 days. Evidence indicates that male muskrats
remain at the same den with the female for several weeks. The young are weaned
at about 1 month of age, but may stay with the parents for awhile longer. Second
litters often overwinter in the same den with their parents. Muskrats' sexual
maturity is reached at about 9 to 10 months of age.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Food habits: Muskrats are basically herbivorous. They feed mainly on
aquatic plants such as the roots and stems of cattails, lilies, sedges, and
grasses. They may occasionally eat some animal life such as mussels, shrimp, and
small fish. Vegetation is collected and stored during the summer for winter use.
Throughout the winter muskrats remain below the ice for great periods of time
eating this stored food and submerged vegetation. They extend their feeding
areas by constructing “pushups” which are piles of vegetation deposited on
the surface of the ice over an opening. Muskrats bring vegetation to these
pushups and eat it there. These pushups also provide the muskrats with a
protected place above water and away from their den where they can breathe and
rest. Repeated use usually keeps the pushups free of ice. During winters with
little snow and very cold temperatures, pushups commonly freeze solid. As a
result, muskrats cannot use them as breathing holes or as locations to eat and
rest. This condition can contribute to large over winter die-offs of muskrats.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">As the ice thickens during the winter, less area is available for foraging.
Muskrats are forced to leave shallow ponds to spend their time in deeper ponds
to search for food. Deep ponds and channels often have less aquatic vegetation
than shallower ones, thus they can support fewer muskrats. Competition for food
causes rapid depletion of the available supply. This may result in exhaustion of
food supplies and subsequent fighting, starvation, or emigration of the
muskrats. There are seldom any unoccupied living spaces available and many
emigrants freeze, starve, or are killed by predators.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Economic use: The open season for harvesting muskrats in most of
Alaska begins around November 1 with a late September opening in the eastern
Interior. The season closes between mid-May and June 10. Most of the harvested
muskrats are taken in the last month of the season. The fall and winter season
was initiated to encourage the harvest of muskrats before they were lost to
“winter kill,” but there is little trapping then. Eighty percent of the
muskrats harvested in Alaska are taken with .22-caliber rifles. Some trapping
(which is far more time consuming than shooting) takes place in the spring
before ice breakup.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Only a small portion of the total muskrat habitat is hunted or trapped.
Because transportation during the open season in spring is almost entirely by
boat, only the larger streams, ponds, and lakes that can be reached by short
portages can be hunted. Unhunted areas act as natural reservoirs of muskrat
populations which serve to re- populate heavily harvested areas. Muskrat fur is
beautiful and durable and the meat is very tasty and commonly used as human
food.</font>
<p><font face="Calisto MT" size="3" color="#CC0066">Observation: During the summer, muskrats may be observed in many
roadside ponds and sloughs where there is suitable vegetation as a food source.
Often the casual observer will hear a big splash and see something swimming
around in the water, giving the impression that the pond is inhabited by large
fish which are jumping and surfacing. Indeed, sometimes there are large pike in
the grassy sloughs, feeding on an occasional muskrat! If the viewer sits quietly
by the edge of the pond or slough, the resident muskrats will soon go about
their business, providing hours of entertainment.</font></p>
