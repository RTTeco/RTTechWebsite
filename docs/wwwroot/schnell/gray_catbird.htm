with brown under tail coverts.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Voice: catlike &quot;<em>mewing</em>&quot; - Long musical and
mechanical notes and phrases. Sometimes seems to mimic other birds.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Range: Breeds from British Columbia, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia
south to Washington, Texas, and Georgia. Winters from the Carolinas and Gulf
Coast southward.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Catbirds are mostly insect eaters and their pleasing song makes
them welcome to your garden. One was spotted in our backyard foraging for
insects with its tail straight up in the air. Alas, he was a very fast hopper
and we were unable to get him to stand still long enough to get a picture.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Calisto MT">Most of the gray catbird's breeding range is in north, central
and eastern United States (from Oregon to New Mexico, to along the East coast),
and south-central and western Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan
and Manitoba). The winter (migratory) range is in the extreme south-east portion
of the USA, along the east coast of Mexico and the Caribbean islands.</font>

<p><font face="Calisto MT">The gray catbird is a small bird anywhere from 21-24 cm (~8.5 inches) long.
Sexes are monomorphic, and both males and females are dark grey in color with a
black cap and black tail feathers (National Geographic Society 1999). There is a
chestnut patch underneath the tail coverts. Chicks are covered by brown or dark
grey down. It has been noted that eastern populations are generally darker grey
than western populations. The grey catbird has short rounded wings and long
rounded tail feathers, with a short black bill, black eyes and black feet and
legs (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>

<!-- natural-history/food-habits -->
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT">The gray catbird mostly forages in treetops and on the ground. They are
  insectivores, and their diet may consist of hymenoptera (ants), coleoptera
  (beetles), diptera (flies), and lepidoptera (caterpillars and moths). They are
  also considered to be frugivores, as their diet may include fruits of plants
  such as <em>Myrica</em>, <em>Sassafras</em>, <em>Prunus</em>, <em>Cordea</em>,
  and <em>Trema</em>. However it is not known if the digestive tract is
  specifically modified to deal with fruit (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>

<h3> <a name="reproduction"><font color="#669900" face="Calisto MT">Reproduction</font></a></h3>
<!-- natural-history/reproduction -->
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT">The gray catbird builds a bulky, open nest that is low to the ground
  (within 2 m) (Cimprich and Moore 1995). It is made from twigs, scraps, and
  paper bits (Northern Michigan Birding Website 2000). Eggs are laid from April
  to early August (usually 2 broods). Turquoise-colored eggs are a subelliptical
  shape, about 17 mm by 24 mm(Cimprich and Moore 1995). Usually about 4-6 eggs
  are laid in one brood (Northern Michigan Birding Website 2000). Incubation is
  about 12-14 days and young are altricial. Parents shade the young in the nest
  by perching on the rim with their wings spread and breast feathers fluffed.
  Both males and females feed young, whose diet usually consists only of small
  invertebrates. Young depart from the nest ten to eleven days after hatching,
  and their first breeding occurs after their first complete migration, after
  their first year (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>

<!-- natural-history/behavior -->
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT">The gray catbird is a monogamous species. Within the pair bond, the males
  will display during courtship by a head-down-fluffed feathers display. Pairs
  are territorial during the breeding season, but during migration they occur in
  flocks of about 10-15 birds. The males will defend a small territory about
  15-18 m apart, and defend separate territories, they often change territory
  within the breeding season. Gray catbirds will very seldom return to the same
  breeding site year after year. Flight patterns of the gray catbird are short
  and low and they usually do not fly over wide, open spaces. Gray catbirds are
  preyed upon by snakes, some Falconiformes, some Strigiformes (owls), other
  larger passerines (American crow - <em>Corvus brachyrhynchos</em>), small
  rodents like squirrels and shrews, and the occasional domestic cat. They
  elicit a strong response to predators, and will display and flash wings by
  either attempting to attack the predator and/or flying and hopping around it,
  making its characteristic mew noise. (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>

<!-- natural-history/habitat and natural-history/biomes -->
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Calisto MT">The gray catbird lives in dense thickets of woodlands, and shrub-like
  vegetation, and is occasionally found in residential areas (National
  Geographic Society 1999; Cimprich and Moore 1995). They are also found around
  some forest edges, not usually in areas with high conifer density. The use of
  forested habitat is more prevelant on the wintering ground than on the
  breeding ground (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>

  <p><font face="Calisto MT">Often considered a human pest because of its preference for fruit such as
  blueberries, and raspberries, etc. (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- conservation -->
<p><font face="Calisto MT">Humans have increased the suitability of urban areas for catbirds by planting
shrubs. However habitats have declined because of elimination of fencerows
around agricultural areas, as well as human encroachment due to ever-growing
human coastal populations. The gray catbird is considered a common species, but
some declines in breeding populations have been noticed (Cimprich and Moore
1995).</font></p>
<!-- other-comments -->
<p><font face="Calisto MT">The gray catbird has a characteristic song that consists of cat-like 'mew'
noises, this is its most recognizable feature, it also make a 'quirt' or
'clucking' noise, and a 'ratchet' call (Cimprich and Moore 1995).</font></p>
