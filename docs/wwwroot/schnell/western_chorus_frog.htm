<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The Western Chorus Frog can be 
identified by the white or cream colored stripe that is found along its upper 
lip.&nbsp; They are a greenish-gray to brown color and also have three dark 
stripes down its back.&nbsp; Adults usually grow to about 1.9 to 3.8 centimeters 
in length.&nbsp; They eat a variety of small invertebrates, including ants, 
flies, beetles, moths, and spiders.&nbsp; Their habitat can be found in or near 
shallow bodies of water.&nbsp; The voice of a Western Chorus Frog is&nbsp; 
similar to the sound of a fingernail running along the teeth of a fine-toothed 
comb.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF">The breeding season of a Western 
Chorus Frog is from March to May.&nbsp; The breeding sites include the edges of 
shallow ponds, ditches, wooded swamps, and flooded fields.&nbsp; The female will 
lay 500-1500 eggs in several clusters, which usually contain 20 to 300 eggs.&nbsp; 
The eggs will hatch in 3 to 14 days.&nbsp; Western Chorus Frogs usually stay 
close to their breeding grounds throughout the year, and they also hibernate in 
these places.</font></p>
