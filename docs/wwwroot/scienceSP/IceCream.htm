      <p>When heat is added to a solid, the kinetic energy<br>
      &nbsp;of the molecules in
      the solid increases and the&nbsp;<br>
 increased motion of the molecules is reflected
      by a&nbsp;<br>
 rise in the temperature of the solid.&nbsp; When the&nbsp;<br>
 melting point of
      the substance is reached, however,&nbsp;<br>
 the temperature remains constant as the
      change of&nbsp;<br>
 phase occurs.&nbsp; The continued addition of heat at&nbsp;<br>
 that
      temperature is used to cause changes in&nbsp;<br>
 potential energy, which result in
      the loosening of&nbsp;<br>
 bonds between the molecules. The heat required&nbsp;<br>
 to change
      a solid to a liquid with no change in&nbsp;<br>
 temperature is called the latent
      heat of fusion.</p>

        The history of ice cream goes back a long way - possibly to around 200BC 
        in China - but certainly to the point where much of its early history is 
        no more than folklore. Many stories abound of famous people enjoying 
        early forms of ice cream - from the Roman Emperor Nero who is said to 
        have had snow brought down from the mountains to freeze his favorite 
        drinks, to Marco Polo who returned from the Far East with a type of

        The first step towards giving us the kind of ice cream we enjoy today 
        was made by Nancy Johnson (USA) who invented the hand-crank freezer 
        (1846). In the 1920s Clarence Vogt produced the first continuous process 
        freezer which opened up the possibility for commercial ice cream 
        manufacture.</font></td>
