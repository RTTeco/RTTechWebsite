<p align="center">EXPLORING TECHNOLOGY<br>
MATERIALS PROCESSING<br>
HOT METALS AREA</p>

<p>You will have an opportunity to learn useful knowledge of the foundry industry by
molding an anvil&nbsp; paper weight, an anchor paper weight, a key, or a door knocker for
a project in this module. The methods used to produce molded products are different
because patterns are different. Yet the procedure followed to make the products and
prepare them for distribution (shipping) is generally the same. There are six steps in
this procedure. However, not all of the six steps may be necessary. This depends on the
product being made. Raw materials are provided by nature. They may be grown such as trees,
cotton, and grain, or raised such as sheep and cattle. Others are extracted (taken) from
the ground, water, or air, iron ore, petroleum, and oxygen. The first step in production
is to change the raw material into a form useful for making a product. Iron ore is a raw
material, but it is useless until it is refined (has impurities removed). Then it can be
combined with other refined minerals to make steel. In the same way, a tree cannot be used
to make a product until it is changed into lumber. These raw materials are sometimes
called industrial materials. A raw material is more useful when it is converted (changed)
into standard stock or sometimes referred to as industrial materials . This means that the
material is formed into a standard (widely used) size and shape. Think how hard it would
be to work with and transport (move) a thick piece of steel the size of your classroom.
Standard stock sizes are smaller and easier to handle. Also, planning products is easier
when the sizes and shapes or materials are known. Lumber and sheet metal, for example, can
be purchased in standard sizes. Standard stock is made into the components (individual
parts) of a product. Some products have one component, such as a comb, a key, or a coin.
Many products are made up of many individual components. The handle grip is one component
of a motorcycle. The lead and the eraser are components of a pencil. The components are
assembled (put together in a planned way) with other components. This can be done by a
number of methods. Components may be put together with glue, by welding, or with screws,
bolts, or nails. A combination of methods may be used. The motorcycle handle grip is
assembled with the handlebar to make a subassembly. The lead and eraser are assembled with
other components to make a pencil. When all the components are assembled and inspected,
the result is a finished product. Motorcycles, pencil, nuclear submarines, space shuttles,
and safety pins are all finished products. Often, finished products are components of
other products. For example, the light bulb is a finished component of a desk lamp. Tires
are finished components of the motorcycle. The finished product is prepared for
distribution to protect in during shipping. Many products need to be placed in packages to
protect them or make them easy to handle. Products are usually stored in a warehouse
(storage building) before shipment to consumers. They are then loaded onto trucks, trains,
boats, or planes, or pumped into pipelines to be transported to the consumer. In
this
booklet you will learn about how standard stock materials are cast or molded into
components or one piece finished products. Casting or molding is a forming process in
which standard stock in liquid form or semi liquid form is poured or pumped into the cavity
(hollow space) of a mold or die. The liquid takes the shape of the walls of the cavity. It
then hardens so that it will keep that shape. The finished piece is called a casting, or a
molded part. It has the size, shape, and finish of the mold cavity in which it was made.
The standard stock for casting metal is an ingot or pig. Before solid standard stock can
be cast or molded, it must be heated until it becomes a liquid or semi liquid. The metal
you will be using in your product will become liquid at a temperature of 625-700
degrees. The cavity of the mold must be an empty space just the size and shape of the part
or product to be cast. Also, workers must be able to get the hardened casting out of the
mold.</p>

<p align="center">INTRODUCTION TO METAL CASTING</p>

<p>The foundry process has for centuries played an important part our total technological
development. Castings have been found in the region between the lower Tigris and Euphrates
river which date back as far as 5000 B.C. These castings were copper axe heads with a
hollow end into which a wooden handle could be forced. This indicated that a cored mold
had been used, and the appearance of the casting seems to indicate a &quot;closed&quot;
mold. Such sophisticated foundry procedure at this early date is amazing since it was many
years later that iron was discovered. The art of metal casting has been continuously and
increasingly essential to civilizations advance. Today metal casting ranks high among
America's greatest industries and is a basic industry vital to all civilization. It was
around 1750 when Huntsman, an Englishman, originated the crucible process. This process
brought about the first produced steel that was able to be poured as a liquid. Later the
work of Johann Conrad Fischer, a Swiss metallurgist, brought about the first steel
castings which were formed in a loam molds. The forming of useful products by the casting
of molten metals is a long established industry. It is, more over, in the forefront among
those industries which have advanced rapidly in recent years from dependence upon rule of
thumb methods to operations based on the use of scientific principles. In today's
industries, foundry work ranges from the simple materials handling to actual casting
production, and includes highly technical research. Certain foundry jobs require
considerable manual dexterity and skill while others call for imagination and the ability
to develop a completed pattern and casting from blue prints. Many different types of
workers are needed in the foundry industry. They include the molding, core making, melting,
cleaning, and control or testing. There is one other department which is frequently
affiliated with foundries which is called the pattern making department. The first step in
the production of any casting is the development and construction of a pattern. Patterns
can be made out of wood, metal, plaster, plastic and clay. Pattern making is as outstanding
a craft as can be found in any industry. It must be remembered that the final casting can
only be as good as the pattern from which it is made; therefore, skill and craftsmanship
are two of the most important aspects in the production of a quality product. A pattern
maker may design his/her own product or work from a engineering drawing to construct
patterns in accordance with principles of good foundry practice. They often consult
directly with the designer of the casting. The types of patterns or the project that you
may choose takes many forms. The anvil paper weight is a split pattern (two piece). The
door knocker is a one piece pattern. Notice the door knocker has a flat side. All one
piece patterns will have one flat side. The clangor for the door knocker is a split or two
piece pattern. The &quot;key&quot; and the anchor paper weight are match plate patterns.
Notice one part of the project is mounted on each side of the match plate. Molds are made
by the use of patterns. Foundry workers have developed many types of molding: sand
molding, plaster molding, investment casting, permanent molding, shell molding and
injection casting. The oldest and most commonly used method of casting is the conventional
sand molding, because it has the lowest initial cost, permits greater flexibility in
design, choice of alloy, and allows design changes during production. For these reasons,
sand casting is the method generally used to make a limited number of cast pieces. foundry
In the last few years there has been a tremendous advancement in the foundry industry in
the form of automation, mechanization and technical progress. The future job security of
foundry workers is good and can be emphasized by attempting to imagine a world without
cast metals. Metal castings are increasingly in demand in an increasing variety of forms
for an increasing number of uses. The foundry industry is large, consisting of over 5000
foundries located all over North America, thus offering employment possibilities almost
anywhere. During a normal peace time year, foundries in North America produces over
20,000,000 tons of castings of all sizes and shapes from metals such as gray iron,
malleable iron, steel, brass and bronze, aluminum and others. Castings are fundamental to
the economic development of the community and nation. Try to name one thing that is not a
casting or does not have castings directly responsible for its manufacture. It can not be
done.</p>

<p align="center">SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOUNDRY WORK</p>

<p>Safety First Safety is an important part of every job. Working with hot metals and
foundry tools can be dangerous. It's important to respect the equipment and the metals you
are working with. Always think &quot;safety&quot;</p>

<p>1. Never pour a mold unless you are sure that the moisture content of the sand is
correct. Too mush moisture in the sand will cause an explosion. Always have your
instructor check the moisture content of any molding sand that you have tempered before
using it to make a mold.</p>

<p>2. Be extremely careful that no water drops into a crucible of melted metal. The water
would cause an explosion which would throw hot metal on you or anyone else near. Be sure
that tools such as the skimmer which come in contact with the hot metal or the crucible
are absolutely dry.</p>

<p>3. Never pour any metal except with permission and under the direct supervision of the
instructor. All other students working near you to step back to a safe distance while your
casting is being poured.</p>

<p>4. You must never lift or handle a crucible of melted metal unless the crucible handles
you use grip it firmly and evenly. Never set the crucible down anywhere except in the
furnace.</p>

<p>5. Always wear goggles when pouring hot metal to protect your eyes in case the metal
spatters.</p>

<p>6. Always roll down your sleeves and wear gauntlet gloves when poring hot metal to
protect your hands and arms from spattering metal.</p>

<p>7. Keep to one side when pouring a flask. Never stand directly above risers or sprue
holes since metal could be thrown out because of steam pressure.</p>

<p>8. Always test a casting just taken from a flask with a moistened finger before you
pick it up.</p>

<p>9. Do not leave furnace plugged in continuously as it will exceed maximum operating
temperature and will burn out the element.</p>

<p>Before you begin with your foundry project, become familiar with the equipment and the
terminology. Read through the instructions first before you begin.</p>

<p>Work carefully and make sure you read the instructions. If you need assistance, be sure
to ask for help. Don't wait until it is too late.</p>

<p align="center">Lets get started! </p>

<p>Temper the sand by sprinkling with water and mixing (mulling) until it compresses into
a mass (a dirt clod) that retains its shape and makes a clean break with sharp faces when
broken. Position the drag half of the flask so that the aligning pins drop into the holes
in the bottoming board. Position the half of the split pattern without the aligning pins
on the bottoming board near the center of the drag. The flat side of the pattern should
face down. If you are making a project using a match plate pattern; place the match plate
between the cope and the drag. Notice on the match plate the side with the sprue. Place
this side down. Dust parting compound over the pattern and the bottoming board. Riddle
fine facing sand over the pattern until it is completely covered to a depth of 1 inch.
This is done so that the casting will have a smooth even surface. Pack the facing sand
using the rammer around the one side of the pattern.. Fill the remainder of the drag with
unriddled tempered foundry sand (backing sand). Ram the sand firmly around the pattern and
the inside edge of the drag using the peen end of the rammer. Fill the drag again and ram.
Repeat this process until the drag is completely full. Use the strike off bar to scrape
off the excess sand flush with the surface of the drag. Use a sawing motion. Place the
molding board (board with no holes) on top of the drag and turn over (with both boards in
position) so that the drag aligning pins point upward. Carefully remove the bottoming
board (board with holes) from the drag. This will expose the flat side of the split
pattern. If you are using a match plate pattern, turn the flask over and you will expose
the other side of the pattern with the sprue locater. Position the top half of the pattern
(side with the aligning pins) over the bottom half. The pins and holes must be clean
before positioning. Dust parting compound on the pattern and exposed sand. The use of
parting compound enables the cope to be separated from the drag without the sand sticking
and also the pattern form sticking to the sand. Place the cope on top of the drag. Because
of the aligning pins, the cope will only go one way. Carefully push the sprue and the
riser pins about 1/8 inch into the sand in the drag about 1/2 inch from the pattern. The
riser pin should be on the opposite side of the pattern from the sprue pin and near the
heaviest part of the pattern. When using the match plate patterns the location of the
sprue is done for you. A riser is not used on our split patterns. Riddle facing sand over
the entire pattern and pack with the rammer in a around the sprue and riser pins. Complete
filling the cope with backing sand and pack with the rammer. Do not ram the sand to hard
or the sand may be forced out of the bottom of the drag. Use the strike off bar to remove
excess sand at the top of the drag. Carefully remove the cope from the drag and set it on
its side. Be sure to lift the cope straight up. Carefully remove the sprue and riser pins
by using a twist and turning action on the pins to loosen them and then pull them straight
out of the cope. Carefully remove the pattern halves from their respective part of the
flask. Lightly tapping will be helpful in loosening patterns from the sand. The match
plate patterns are removed by lifting them off the drag half of the flask straight
up. You have now created a cavity. Vent holes can be placed by poking a series of holes directly
over the pattern. These vent holes allow gases to escape out the top of the cope. Using
the molding spoon form a pouring basin (funnel shape) on the sprue to aid in casting and
pouring. Remove loose sand particles around the basin and the riser. Cut a gate and runner
from the mold to the sprue hole. Smooth, remove and or pack and loose sand. Repeat the
process for the riser hole. Repair any damage to the core. If the core is to badly damage
you may have to start over. This happens because the sand was not tempered, the sand was
packed to tight, the sand was packed to loose. Carefully replace the cope on top of the
drag. Prepare the furnace. The molten metal is the proper temperature when a small piece of
paper is placed in the metal for 30 seconds. The paper will turn golden brown in color but
will not ignite. The molten lead will melt around 680 degrees Fahrenheit. Unplug the
furnace when the metal is heated to it proper temper. Skim any impurities of the top of the
molten metal with the Skimmer. This is referred to as slag, dross, or gangue. You
are ready
to pour the molten metal. Be sure the instructor is present while the pouring is being
done. Make sure you take all the safety precautions. Pour with a slow steady progress. Do
not stop pouring until you see molten metal rise up the riser. Allow the casting to cool
completely before removing the casting from the mold. Remove the casting (knock out) and
clean the casting. Using a hack saw, remove the sprue and riser from the casting. Finish
the casting with the proper tools. Files and sandpaper will smooth your project .You may
paint your casting with your favorite color of paint or leave as is.</p>
