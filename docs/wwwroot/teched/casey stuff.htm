<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Casey At The Bat<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
</center>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;<br>
The score stood four to two with but one inning left to play;<br>
And then, when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br>
A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.
<p>A straggling few got up to go, in deep despair. The rest<br>
Clung to that hope which &quot;springs eternal in the human breast;&quot;<br>
They thought, If only Casey could but get a whack at that,<br>
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.
<p>But Flynn proceed Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br>
And the former was a no-good and the latter was a fake;<br>
So, upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br>
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.
<p>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br>
And Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball,<br>
And when the dust had lifted and men saw what had occurred,<br>
There was Jimmy safe at second, and Flynn a-huggin'' third.
<p>Then from five thousand throats and more their rose a lusty yell,<br>
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell,<br>
It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br>
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.
<p>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br>
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face,<br>
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br>
No stranger in the crowd could doubt `twas Casey at the bat.
<p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br>
Five thousand tongues applauded as he wiped them on his shirt.<br>
Then, while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br>
Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.
<p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br>
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there,<br>
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped --<br>
&quot;That ain't my style,&quot; said Casey. &quot;Strike one,&quot; the umpire
said.
<p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br>
Like the beating of the storm waves on a stern and distant shore.<br>
&quot;Kill him; kill the umpire!&quot; shouted someone from the stand;--<br>
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.
<p>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br>
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br>
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;<br>
But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, &quot;Strike two.&quot;
<p>&quot;Fraud,&quot; cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered
&quot;Fraud,&quot;<br>
But one scornful look from Casey, and the multitude was awed.<br>
The saw his face grow stern and cold; they saw his muscles strain,<br>
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.
<p>The sneer is gone from Casey's lip; his teeth are clenched in hate;<br>
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.<br>
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,<br>
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.
<p>Oh! somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;<br>
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light.<br>
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;<br>
But there is no joy in Mudville -- mighty Casey has Struck Out.

<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><center>Casey's Revenge</center><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
There were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;<br>
There were muttered oaths and curses -- every fan in town was sore.<br>
&quot;Just think,&quot; said one, &quot;how soft it looked with Casey at the
bat!<br>
And then to think he'd go and spring a bush-league trick like that.&quot;
<p>All his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless &quot;shine.&quot;<br>
They called him &quot;Strike-out Casey&quot; from the mayor down the line,<br>
And as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,<br>
While a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey's eye.
<p>The lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again,<br>
And fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men.<br>
And Casey smiled -- his rugged face no longer wore a frown;<br>
The pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.
<p>All Mudville had assembled; ten thousand fans had come<br>
To see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;<br>
And when he stepped into the box, the multitude went wild.<br>
He doffed his cap in proud disdain -- but Casey only smiled.
<p>&quot;Play ball!,&quot; the umpire's voice rang out, and then the game began;<br>
But in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan<br>
Who thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun<br>
Their hopes sank low -- the rival team was leading &quot;four to one.&quot;
<p>The last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;<br>
But when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.<br>
The din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard<br>
When the pitcher hit the second and gave &quot;four balls&quot; to the third.
<p>Three men on base -- nobody out -- three runs to tie the game!<br>
A triple meant the highest niche in Mudville's hall of fame;<br>
But here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night<br>
When the fourth one &quot;fouled to catcher&quot; and the fifth &quot;flew out
to right.&quot;
<p>A dismal groan in chorus came -- a scowl was on each face --<br>
When Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;<br>
His bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate;<br>
He gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.
<p>But fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;<br>
There were no wild and wooly cheers, no glad acclaim this day.<br>
They hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, &quot;Strike him out!&quot;<br>
But Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard this shout.
<p>The pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread;<br>
Another hiss, another groan. &quot;Strike one!&quot; the umpire said.<br>
Zip! Like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee--<br>
&quot;Strike two!&quot; the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.
<p>No roasting for the umpire now -- his was an easy lot;<br>
But here the pitcher whirled again -- was that a rifle shot?<br>
A whack! a crack! and out through space the leather pellet flew,<br>
A blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.
<p>Above the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight,<br>
The sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.<br>
Ten thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit,<br>
But no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit!
<p>Oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun.<br>
And some where bands no longer play children have no fun;<br>
And somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall;<br>
But Mudville hearts are happy now -- for Casey hit the ball!

<p align="center"><big><b><i>Casey-Twenty Years Later</i></b></big>
<p align="left">The Bugville Team was surely up against a rocky game;<br>
The chances were they'd win defeat and undying fame;<br>
Three men were hurt and two were benched; the score stood six to four.<br>
They had to make three hard-earned runs in just two innings more.
<p align="left">&quot;It can't be done,&quot; the captain said, a pallor on his
face;<br>
&quot;I've got two pitchers in the field, a mutt on second base;<br>
And should another man get spiked or crippled in some way,<br>
The team would sure be down and out, with eight men left to play.
<p align="left">&quot;We're up against it anyhow as far as I can see;<br>
My boys ain't hitting like they should and that's what worries me;<br>
The luck is on the other side, no pennant will we win;<br>
It's mighty tough, but we must take our medicine and grin.&quot;<br>
<br>
The eighth round opened; one, two, three; the enemy went down;<br>
The Bugville boys went out the same, the captain wore a frown;<br>
The first half of the ninth came round, two men had been called out,<br>
The Bugville's pitcher broke a thumb and could not go the route.
<p align="left">A deathly silence settled o'er the crowd assembled there.<br>
Defeat would be allotted them; They felt it in the air;<br>
With only eight men in the field 'twould be a gruesome fray,-<br>
Small wonder that the captain cursed the day he learned to play.
<p align="left">&quot;Lend me a man to finish with,&quot; he begged the other
team;<br>
&quot;Lend you a man?&quot; the foe replied; My boy, you're in a dream;<br>
We want to win the pennant, too-that's what we're doing here.<br>
There's only one thing you can do-call for a volunteer.&quot;
<p align="left">The captain stood and pondered in a listless sort of way;<br>
He never was a quitter and would not be today!<br>
&quot;Is there within the grandstand here&quot;-his voice rang loud and clear-<br>
&quot;A man who has the sporting blood to be a volunteer?&quot;
<p align="left">Again that awful silence settled o'er the multitude;<br>
Was there a man among them with such recklessness imbued?<br>
The captain stood with cap in hand, while hopeless was his glance,<br>
And then a short and stocky man cried out, &quot;I'll take a chance.&quot;
<p align="left">Into the field he bounded with a step both firm and light;<br>
&quot;Give me the mask and mitt,&quot; he said; &quot;let's finish up the fight.<br>
The game is now beyond recall; I'll last at lest a round;<br>
Although I'm ancient you will find me muscular and sound.&quot;
<p align="left">His hair was sprinkled here and there with little streaks of
gray;<br>
Around his eyes and on his brow a bunch of wrinkles lay.<br>
The captain smiled despairingly and slowly turned away.<br>
&quot;Why, he's all right,&quot; on rooter yelled. Another, &quot;Let him
play.&quot;
<p align="left">&quot;All right, go on,&quot; the captain sighed; the stranger
turned around,<br>
Took off his coat and collar, too, and threw them on the ground.<br>
The humor of the situation seemed to hit them all,<br>
And as he donned the mask and mitt, the umpire called, &quot;Play ball!&quot;
<p align="left">Three balls the pitcher at him hurled, three balls of lightning
speed;<br>
The stranger caught them all with ease and did not seem to heed.<br>
Each ball had been pronounced a strike, the side had been put out,<br>
And as he walked in towards the bench, he heard the rooters shout.
<p align="left">One Bugville boy went out on strikes, and one was killed at
first;<br>
The captain saw his awkward pose, and gnashed his teeth and cursed.<br>
The third man smashed a double and the fourth man swatted clear,<br>
Then, in a thunder of applause, up came the volunteer.
<p align="left">His feet were planted in the earth, he swung a warlike club;<br>
The captain saw his awkward pose and softly whispered, &quot;Dub!&quot;<br>
The pitcher looked at him and grinned, then heaved a mighty ball;<br>
The echo of that fearful swat still lingers with us all.
<p align="left">High fast and far that spheroid flew; it&nbsp;sailed and sailed
away;<br>
It ne'er was found, so it's supposed it still floats on today.<br>
Three runs came in, the pennant would be Bugville's for a year;<br>
The fans and players gathered round to cheer the volunteer.
<p align="left">&quot;What is your name,&quot; the captain asked? &quot;Tell us
your name,&quot; cried all,<br>
as down his cheeks great tears were seen to run and fall.<br>
For one brief moment he was still, then murmured soft and low;<br>
&quot;I'm mighty Casey who struck out just twenty years ago.&quot;
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
