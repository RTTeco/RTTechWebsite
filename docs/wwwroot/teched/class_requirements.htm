<p class="MsoNormal">During the fourth quarter of photography you will be
divided into four groups. You will have an opportunity to be in the darkroom at
least once every week during normal class time. The times you are not in the
darkroom, you will be rolling, and developing film. When
you are finished with an enlargement, there is print finishing to do (mounting,
matting and framing). You have a research paper to work on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Plan you day and days in advance. You will have something
to do every day.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your photographic assignment for the remainder of the year
is as follows…<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">You
    will hand in a minimum of 7 enlargements suitable for framing. Graded under
    the criteria found on the Picture Assignments located on Mr. Rohwedder’s
    Web Site. These photographs need to be 3 x 5, 5 x 7, or 8 x 10 to fit in
    ordinary mattes and picture frames if desired. All photographs will be
    matted and displayed within the school. Themes and subjects are recommended
    by the information obtained on the web site. Contact prints and test prints
    must accompany any print to receive full credit.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">There
    is no minimum amount of film or type of film required. Each student may
    shoot any number of rolls to maximize the quality to their work.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Each
    student has made a pinhole camera. Each student will submit&nbsp; two (2) photographs
    taken via the pinhole camera. These also should be matted.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Each
    student will explore a short unit in the making of photo grams. Each
    student will hand in one (1) photo gram of their choice and matte them.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Each
    student will hand in a written essay on a well-known or master photographer.
    This essay should be a comprehensive written report by means of research and
    writing. An equivalent to one type written 12 point type and double spaced,
    standard margins of one inch top, bottom, right and left sides per day will
    be acceptable. This would consist of a total page count of 10 pages. Your
    report may and should include pictures of your Photographers work. The
    research of this project can be done by means including the Internet,
    reference books and autobiography. The research paper will include footnotes
    and bibliography. This essay is to be in your own words. Proof read and
    edited. This paper will be place in a covered report portfolio when
    finished. You may choose any master photographer from Mr. Rohwedder’s Web
    Site. There are about 150 to choose from. There will be no
    duplication of subject (one master-one student). All work will be done in
    the technology building bring the reference material with you to class.
    There are enough word processors for your group in your rotation.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Other
    requirements to the class are to view a number of videos dealing with
    photography, and reviewing what other photographers have done via magazines.
    Keeping the lab areas clean. Keeping the stock solutions in
    good supply.</li>
