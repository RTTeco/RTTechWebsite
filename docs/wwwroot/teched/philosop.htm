<p><b>RICHARDTON PUBLIC SCHOOL </b></p>

<p><b>INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION / TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION </b></p>

<p><b>ANDREW C. ROHWEDDER: INSTRUCTOR </b></p>

<p><b>RATIONALE </b></p>

<p>Our world is rapidly changing, new discoveries are being made every day, and the
parallel paths of science and technology continue to move ahead at an ever-acceleration
pace. Recent innovations in communication, medicine, transportation, robotics, energy and
aeronautics technology are evidence of the demands of our futuristic society. We are now
living in an &quot;information age&quot; in which such demands can only be met by citizens
who yearn to discover and strive to excel. People today live differently than they did
even five years ago. Technology is responsible for many of these changes. Wireless cable
TV, cording/portable telephones, fiber optics, high definition television and electronic
mail service are recent developments in communications. Energy utilization systems
encompass more than the traditional fossil fuels. Production systems no longer consist of
only the human operated mass production line, as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and
robotics have replaced many factory workers. Transportation technology has a major break
through with the success of the space shuttle. Our focus must be on today's technologies
and today's industries. Richardton High Schools plan for Industrial / Technical Education
strives to provide direction to the student as they plan, manage and evaluate their
futures and help them become technologically literate. </p>

<p><strong>PHILOSOPHY</strong></p>

<p>Technology Education at Richardton High School is a part of the learning experiences of
all students at grade levels of 8 - 12 and of all abilities, in order that they may
understand and learn to control their industrial technological environment. This education
field can develop an awareness and provide knowledge about technical, consumer,
occupational, recreational, organizational, managerial, social, historical, and cultural
aspects of industry and technology. Through technology education a student can acquire
skills in problem solving, design, construction, transportation, communications,
manufacturing, and research and development with the resulting personal and technological
effects. Technology education deals with the principles and concepts of industry. It
concerns itself with industrial production and servicing. Including a study of such
principles as application of mechanisms, influences of automation and robotics, and mass
production. Industrial / Technology Education draws its content from technological
developments for an ever changing society and its needs. Furthermore it provides direction
for students in deciding a meaningful and successful career choice along with extended
education aspects and ecological responsibilities. </p>
