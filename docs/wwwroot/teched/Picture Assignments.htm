<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666">Street Poetry</font><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Streets, malls, the front of school and neighborhood are
teeming with interesting people and faces. Capture these human artifacts as they
are found in a daily routine. A tripod, long lens or a converter, prefacing and
patience are helpful but not necessary</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="6" color="#336666">Shop<o:p>
 Until You Drop (the shutter)</font></o:p>
</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Small shop and storefronts has become a vanishing breed.
They are falling victim to the Wal-mart and Big K type stores. Try and capture the uniqueness of a one
of a kind or family-run emporia, grocery, barber, butcher etc, a wide-angle lens
for the interior may help. Shooting after hours or in times of slow traffic
would be beneficial. Watch out for your reflections in glass.<o:p>

<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666">Be A Sports Recorder</font><!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Choose a sport. Choose a player, preferably a starter.

She or their family may compensate you later for your efforts.&nbsp;<o:p>

<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">The Trades<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Photograph someone working in the occupation they were
trained. Show their intensity, the sweat, the pressure, the stress, the love the
job these people do. Move in close, but not to close, one should be able to
recognize the profession they are in. Be sure you get permission first. Don’t
forget to bracket. Shoot at different angles.</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666" size="6">Fill the Frame</font>
<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p><b><o:p></o:p></b>Get close and personal with your subject and fill the frame
with it. Choose a characteristic of the object that translates what the object
is without showing all of it.<br>
The red seams of a baseball, the vein in a leaf, and the tread of a tire are
good examples. Just another exercise in expanding the composition thought
process. Don't forget to bracket.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666">Ice Baby Ice</font>
<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>In no reference to ice cream. I'm talking about the fantastic compositions
that nature produces with frost and ice storms. Not great for driving in, but
it's generally not wise to operate machinery while taking pictures anyway. No
need to go further than your back yard to find amazing images. This is a great
time to use that close up lens, get close, and fill the frame with those crystal
structures of both ice and frost.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666"><font color="#336666">(No) Vacancy</font>

as a
still life object. Let me know<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“where”
the room is; give me an insight to the occupants personality. A wide angle would
be help full, be
sure to bracket.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Windows
<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>From picture, broken, and stained glass; there are hundreds of windows in the
world. Capture this image by filling your frame and moving in close. Look for
backlighting. Photograph an object in front or outside the window to give it
some depth.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Protecting the Interest of Out Children.
<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Feel free to interpret this theme however you like-use your imagination.
Perhaps you'd like to take a photograph of children riding their bikes while
wearing their safety helmets, or of a traffic crossing guard, guiding children
across the street. A young sibling in the back seat buckled in a seatbelt.
People do not need to be in your photo. The rubber chips beneath the monkey bars
at a local playground. A warning label on a bottle of medicine. Find a striking
image and keep your eyes open.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Images of Freedom
<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>Take a photography that represents what freedom means to you. A soldier in
uniform, a fourth of July celebration. There are numerous occasions a&nbsp;
photographer could capture a moment with this theme.
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Curves
<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>The S curve is one of the best ways to use leading lines to take the viewer
in to your photograph. Find a curve and concentrate on it in your picture. Move
in close or use a zoom, fill the frame.&nbsp;
</p>
<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#006666">Grading your photographs<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Your photos will be graded in six categories: Composition,
Technique, Exposure, Interest, Matting and finishing, and Your Documentation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Composition: </b>The manner in which the photo is setup
and the creativity used putting together the photo.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Technique:</b> This involves how the picture was taken,
special effects, and lenses, shutter speeds, focusing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Exposure:</b> This involves the exposure of the photo.
Perfectly exposed pictures will score higher than poorly exposed photos. Does
your photo have all the shades of black – gray – white?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Interest:</b> Involves how the photo catches one’s eye
and how well if fits in the theme selected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Matting:</b> Involves how well the mat and photo are
finished, suitable for framing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Your Documentation:</b> Involves the information
required to duplicate your photograph. Do you know the film type, shutter speed,
and lens opening, and any other information that would be beneficial to another
photographer? Darkroom statistics... type of paper, enlarger settings, exposure
times, these need to be documented.</p>
