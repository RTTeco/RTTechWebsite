Rocketry</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Aerospace technology is the study of the technology used to design, </big><br>
<big>build and fly airplanes, helicopters, missiles, rockets, spacecraft and related </big><br>
<big>items. It also includes the study of the information produced by these items. </big><br>
<big>A subdivision of aerospace technology is aeronautics. Aeronautics is the science </big><br>
<big>of flying through the atmosphere. It involves designing, building, testing, and </big><br>
<big>operating aircraft. This module focuses on the area of aerospace technology</big><br>
<big>related to rocketry. A rocket is a device that carries its own supply of fuel and </big><br>
<big>oxygen for combustion. It can operate in an environment that contains no air. </big><br>
<big>Rockets have used to power a variety of vehicles. Spacecraft, missiles, boats, </big><br>
<big>and automobiles have all been powered by rockets. Early History Remember </big><br>
<big>the last time you looked up at the star filled night sky? Did you ever wonder </big><br>
<big>what it would be like to travel to a distant planet or solar system? You would </big><br>
<big>not be alone, if you dreamed of such things. Since the beginning of time, </big><br>
<big>humans have wondered about the vastness of the universe and the stars, planets</big><br>
<big>and moons that fill it. Rockets are the oldest form of self-contained vehicles in </big><br>
<big>existence. Forerunners to the rocket were in use more than a thousand years ago. <br>
Over a long and exciting history, rockets have evolved into mighty vehicles </big><br>
<big>capable of launching a spacecraft that can travel out into the galaxy beyond our </big><br>
<big>solar system. One of the first devices to employ the principles essential to rocket </big><br>
<big>flight successfully was a wooden bird. According to legend, a Greek named </big><br>
<big>Archyas amused the citizens of Tarentum with a flying pigeon suspended on </big><br>
<big>wires and propelled by escaping steam. Three hundred years after the pigeon, </big><br>
<big>another Greek, Hero , invented a similar rocket type device called a arolipile. </big><br>
<big>Today we call this device a Hero engine. A fire below a rotating water kettle <br>
created a turbine type instrument. The Chinese developed the first means of letting</big><br>
<big>people soar with the birds about 350 B.C. Their discovery of how to make kites </big><br>
<big>large enough to lift people into the air is similar to modern day hang gliding. The </big><br>
<big>first rockets appeared in China about 1000. They were made by tying tubes to long </big><br>
<big>shafts (similar to the bottle rockets of today. The tube contained early forms of </big><br>
<big>gunpowder. Rockets during this period were not meant to harm the enemy, but to </big><br>
<big>scare and confuse the horses and men with loud explosions. In mid-thirteenth century,
</big><br>
<big>trade routes established during earlier times, carried word of gunpowder and <br>
rockets to the Middle East and Europe. Over the next five hundred years the </big><br>
<big>development of the rocket was slow. The ratio of chemical used in gunpowder were </big><br>
<big>refined. Fins were added to the rocket for greater stability. An important step in
the </big><br>
<big>development of the rocket was made by Conrad Hass in 1532. His ideas on staging </big><br>
<big>(a series of gunpowder filled tubes) allowed rockets to travel greater distances. By
the </big><br>
<big>end of the nineteenth century the use of rockets had given way to artillery and
rifles.</big><br>
<big>Up until 1926 all rockets had been powered by solid fuel (gunpowder). In March of </big><br>
<big>that year, Dr. Robert Goddard successfully flew the first liquid powered (gasoline
and </big><br>
<big>oxygen) rocket. The rocket rose to a height of 41 feet and fell to earth 172 feet
from the</big><br>
<big>point of take off. For his success, Dr. Goddard is known as the &quot;father of the
rocket&quot;. </big><br>
<big>From this seemingly unimpressive beginning modern aerospace technology began.</big><br>
<big>Major advancements in rocket technology were made by German scientists during </big><br>
<big>World War II. Lead by Dr. Wernher von Braun, German scientists designed, built and </big><br>
<big>flew rockets that carried one ton of explosive over 190 miles. The German rocket
known </big><br>
<big>as the V-2 dropped from the skies over England causing death and destruction. After
the </big><br>
<big>war, many German scientists came to the United States and continued their research on
</big><br>
<big>rockets. From these men came the foundation for the space program we know today.</big><br>
<big>Modern historian October 4, 1957, the former Soviet Union began the space age. That </big><br>
<big>was the date on which Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, was placed in orbit
around </big><br>
<big>the earth. The United States of America, launched their own rocket twelve days after </big><br>
<big>Sputnik 1. The American rocket placed the first object into orbit around the sun.
Less </big><br>
<big>than three months later, the first living animal, a dog called Laika, was carried by </big><br>
<big>Sputnik 2 into orbit around the earth. The great space race between the United States
</big><br>
<big>and the then Soviet Union had begun. Yuri Gagarin, of the Soviet Air Force, was the
first </big><br>
<big>man in space. In April 1961, he made a complete trip around the earth and landed back
</big><br>
<big>on the earth again. Alan Shepard became the first American in space in May of 1961. </big><br>
<big>During the next few years, several manned vehicles with two or more astronauts were </big><br>
<big>sent up. In 1965 both Soviet and American astronauts performed
&quot;space walks&quot;. A </big><br>
<big>space walk is when the astronaut steps out of the spacecraft and walks in
space. One of
the </big><br>
<big>greatest events in modern aerospace history started on July 20, 1969 with the lift
off of </big><br>
<big>Apollo 11 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Apollo 11 carried three men, Neil
</big><br>
<big>Armstrong, Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. Four days
after lift </big><br>
<big>off, Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. Armstrong's first step </big><br>
<big>onto the moon marked a &quot;giant leap&quot; forward in technology. But just as
great a leap was </big><br>
<big>the technological achievement that was taking place back on earth at the same time.
Live </big><br>
<big>television coverage and world wide transmission of the events on the moon allowed </big><br>
<big>people all over the world to view history in the making. In the early 1970's, United </big><br>
<big>States engineers began working on developing a reusable spacecraft. This became a </big><br>
<big>reality when the Space Shuttle Columbia was launched in April 1981. With the </big><br>
<big>introduction of the space shuttle came the ability to launch payloads from the
shuttle </big><br>
<big>cargo bay. The shuttle also allows the recovery of malfunctioning satellites,
repairing </big><br>
<big>them in the shuttle cargo bay, and then relaunching them back into space. This
process </big><br>
<big>was achieved in December of 1983 when the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery </big><br>
<big>recovered, repaired and relaunched the Hubble Space Telescope. This may be a good </big><br>
<big>time to further explore the space shuttle and view the video that is part of this
module. </big><br>
<big>There are some questions on your worksheet that can be answered from the video.</big><br>
<big>Impacts of Aerospace technology 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration </big><br>
<big>(NASA) was formed. This organization has been responsible for the research and </big><br>
<big>development of all aspects of aerospace technology. Many areas have been impacted by </big><br>
<big>their research. Some areas are: Video and photo technology, energy systems design, </big><br>
<big>fabric manufacture, air conditioning, biomedical advances, automotive design,
electrical </big><br>
<big>circuitry and pollution control.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Spinoffs</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Our lives have been drastically changed by the research and</big><br>
<big>development done by the aerospace program. Many of the inventions</big><br>
<big>and conveniences of the modern world have been influenced by the</big><br>
<big>work of scientists, engineers and technicians working for aerospace</big><br>
<big>industries.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The demands of the space program have caused computers to </big><br>
<big>become smaller and faster. Computers are used for guidance and </big><br>
<big>control of spacecraft as well as for communication systems. Much of </big><br>
<big>what we know today of computers and computer related electronics </big><br>
<big>came as a result of the space program. The need to save space and </big><br>
<big>weight in space vehicles brought rapid advances in microelectronics. </big><br>
<big>Micro electronics is the technology that deals with miniaturization of</big><br>
<big>electronic circuits. Some of the benefits from miniature electronics </big><br>
<big>that</big><br>
<big>we now have are, miniature </big><br>
<big>recorders, electronic ignition of vehicles and video games. The area</big><br>
<big>of material technology has benefited by research done by NASA. </big><br>
<big>In the search of lighter and stronger materials, NASA has developed</big><br>
<big>new fabrics, composites and graphite materials. These materials are </big><br>
<big>found in tennis rackets, fishing poles, snow skies, running shoes,</big><br>
<big>airplane, and vehicle construction and clothing. Aerospace technology </big><br>
<big>has provided ways to keep cars, homes and commercial builds </big><br>
<big>warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. A reflective film was</big><br>
<big>designed to protect manned spacecraft from solar radiation. Today, </big><br>
<big>sheets of the same material are put on windows to keep out the </big><br>
<big>sunlight and heat during summer and trap the heat in buildings </big><br>
<big>during the winter. This same material is found in space &quot;blankets&quot;</big><br>
<big>which can be used in emergencies to keep people warm. NASA has </big><br>
<big>done a great deal of research in the area of robotics. This research has </big><br>
<big>lead manufacturers to improve robot capabilities. One such use has </big><br>
<big>been in voice controlled wheel chair for paralyzed and severely </big><br>
<big>handicapped persons. The computer then translates the command </big><br>
<big>into an electrical signal which activates the correct motors to make the</big><br>
<big>wheel chair move.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Principles of Flight</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>There are many things that affect the flight of a rocket. Among these
</big><br>
<big>are Newton's Laws of Motion, the way the rocket is designed and </big><br>
<big>built, and the forces of thrust, gravity, drag and lift. </big></p>

<p align="left"><big>In 1687, an English scientist, Sir Isaac Newton published a book as </big><br>
<big>the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Newton stated </big><br>
<big>three laws of physics that defined the motion behind moving objects. </big><br>
<big>The three laws of motion, described below, have been rewritten with </big><br>
<big>regards to rocketry.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>First Law of Motion</big><br>
<big>When a rocket moves through a vacuum (no friction or gravity) it will </big><br>
<big>continue to move in the same direction and with the same speed until </big><br>
<big>another force changes its direction and speed.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Second Law of Motion</big><br>
<big>The amount of force that a rocket engine needs to produce lift and </big><br>
<big>move is equal to the weight of the rocket and the speed at which it </big><br>
<big>flies.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Third Law of Motion</big><br>
<big>The thrust (pushing force) that a rocket engines causes the rocket to </big><br>
<big>move in a direction opposite that of the thrust.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The three laws of motion can be linked together in the following </big><br>
<big>manner. If the rocket engine produces enough power, after it is </big><br>
<big>ignited, the rocket will lift off and accelerate (second law). The </big><br>
<big>direction the rocket travels is opposite to the direction in which the </big><br>
<big>engine is pointed (third law). The rocket will continue in that direction</big><br>
<big>and with the same speed until another force changes</big> <big>the direction </big><br>
<big>and speed (first law). </big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Newton's laws not only apply to rockets, but to every
moving object.</big><br>
</p>

<p align="left"><big>Component parts of a Rocket</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Rockets, whether they are full size or models, vary in their </big><br>
<big>appearence, fueled by air pressure, solid fuel, or liquid fuel have the </big><br>
<big>same basic parts. </big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The parts in the figures have the following functions.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The nose cone gives the rocket an aerodynamic shape. This reduces
drag as the </big><br>
<big>rocket flies. The nose cone may also carry the payload.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The recovery system is how the rocket is recovered when it falls </big><br>
<big>back to the surface of the earth. reliable recovery systems include </big><br>
<big>tumble, parachute, glider, streamer, helicopter, featherweight and </big><br>
<big>break-apart systems.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The body tube or fuselage is the largest part of a rocket. It houses </big><br>
<big>the recovery system and engine (s).</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The launch lug is used on some rockets to hold the model rocket on </big><br>
<big>the launch pad and give the rocket stability in take off until the rocket </big><br>
<big>has enough speed so the fins can take over the steering of the rocket. </big><br>
<br>
<big>Fins guide the rocket and keep it flying straight after lift off.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The</big> <big>engine holder is used on some rockets to hold the
engine (s) </big><br>
<big>within the body tube.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The engine provides the power needed to cause the rocket to lift off </big><br>
<big>and accelerate.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Forces Acting on a Flight</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>There are </big><br>
<big>operating a computer program on the Apple IIe which will allow you </big><br>
<big>to become familiar with these terms. As you go through the computer </big><br>
<big>program write down the </big>
<big> of these terms and place them in</big><br>
<big>your notebook.</big></p>

<big>Streamer material</big><br>
<br>
<big>At the end of this module you will be able to keep your rocket and </big><br>
<big>take it home.</big><br>
<br>
<big>Some things that you will supply on your own is paint, decals, </big><br>
<big>stickers. A bottle would be nice, the teacher normally can't drink </big><br>
<big>enough soda to supply everyone with a soda bottle. </big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Lets get started!</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>1. Obtain a 20 oz. soda bottle, a larger bottle such as a 1 liter
bottle </big><br>
<big>also works well. A 2 liter bottle gets mighty heavy by the time you are</big><br>
<big>finished. Remember, the greater the mass the greater the drag force</big><br>
<big>and the less acceleration. Make sure your bottle will fit into the </big><br>
<big>launcher. Some bottle manufacturers use smaller molds and addition sanding </big><br>
<big>steps are required before these bottles will fit. Some bottles have ridges inside the
</big><br>
<big>neck of the bottle, these will have to be ground down smooth.</big><br>
<br>
<big><strong>What type of recovery system do you want on your rocket</strong> </big><br>
<br>
<big>Think about the type of recovery system you would like to build into </big><br>
<big>your rocket. If you decide on a tumble recovery, continue on. If you </big><br>
<big>decide on use a streamer system, continue on, then place the streamer </big><br>
<big>material on the string between the plastic insert and the ping pong </big><br>
<big>ball (step 25). If you decide to use the parachute method, step </big><br>
<big>number 8 will be done differently depending upon your design </big><br>
<big>(see figure below)</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>2. Rinse the bottle with cold water, and seal with the cap. When the </big><br>
<big>bottle warms the air inside will pressurize slightly and the bottle will be easier </big><br>
<big>to work with. You may also use a pressure pump to add pressure to you bottle.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>3. Obtain the paper measuring tape supplied in the drawer. You will
use it to </big><br>
<big>determine where the fins will be placed.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>4. Place the measuring tape around the bottle, just above where the
circumference </big><br>
<big>tapers. This is approximately 2 3/8 from the end (cap).</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>5. Using a </big><br>
<big> 3&quot;, 6&quot;, and 9&quot; points.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>6. To make vertical lines for the fin placement, hold the bottle up
against a door </big><br>
<big>frame</big> <big>(see illustration).</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>7. Use the </big><br>
<big>long.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>8. Lightly sand the inside of the bottle feet where the air tube will
fit. Sanding </big><br>
<big>will allow the glue to stick better. If you are using parachute method and a </big><br>
<big>cardboard transition cone skip this step. If you are using a partial bottle for the</big><br>
<big>transition cone lightly sand the feet on this section.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>9. Lightly sand the marked areas where the fins will be placed.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>10. Obtain the air tube and trim it to size. Glue the air tube to the
bottles &quot;feet&quot; </big><br>
<big>using hot glue. If you are designing a parachute recovery system, the air tube will </big><br>
<big>be place on the transition cone only (step 17). Another bottle (lower part) could be </big><br>
<big>used.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>11. Place the bottle in the holding fixture and set aside for a
while.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>12. There are many types and designs for the fins. Choose the style
of fins you </big><br>
<big>would like, or design your own.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>13. Cut out the fin pattern with scissors. Trace around the pattern
on to a piece of </big><br>
<big>thick cardboard, plastic sheets also work well. You will need three fins.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>14. Carefully cut out the fins out using a</big> <big>xacto knife.
Cut on the piece of glass. Do </big><br>
<big>not cut on the counter top. Take several cuts do not try and cut the fin out with </big><br>
<big>one pass of the knife.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>15. With the bottle in the holding device, glue the air tube to the
bottles' bottom. </big><br>
<big>Make sure the air tube is properly aligned.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>16. Use the hot glue to attach the fins to the bottle. Do not apply
the glue to the </big><br>
<big>bottle. You could melt through the bottle and your rocket will be ruined. Make </big><br>
<big>sure they are aligned properly.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>17. Trace around the </big><br>
<big>your choice. Cut out the </big>
<big> cone from a piece of thin tag board. If you are </big><br>
<big>using a larger or smaller than normal soda bottle, you may have to design your </big><br>
<big>own </big>
<big> cone.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>18. Roll it in your hand to give the cone some shape.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>19. Form the cone over your rocket and secure the cone with
transparent tape </big><br>
<big>(you may need some help with this step).</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>20. Use hot glue to secure the cone to the rocket. Be careful not to
melt through the </big><br>
<big>bottle.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>21. Allow the glue to cool.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>22. You may decorate your rocket as you choose. You will have to
supply your </big><br>
<big>own paint, decals or stickers. Be creative, making your rocket look as realistic as </big><br>
<big>possible.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>23. The ping pong ball is the nose cone for your rocket. If the ball
is not attached </big><br>
<big>to a piece</big> <big>of string, you may attach it now. Do not melt through the ball.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>24. If the string is not threaded through the plastic insert, tied,
and glued you may</big><br>
<big> do this now.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>25. Carefully ease the plastic insert into the end of the air tube.
If it is loose, put </big><br>
<big>some tape around the insert to snug it up. If the plastic insert does not fit, make </big><br>
<big>two slits in the tube with </big>
<big> on opposite sides to spread the tube. Then seal </big><br>
<big>the plastic insert to the tube with tape.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>26. Make sure that the string, attached to the ball is not tangled.
If you are using</big><br>
<big>the streamer recovery system, tie about 12 inches of streamer material midway </big><br>
<big>between the plastic insert and the ping pong ball. Place the ball on top of the </big><br>
<big>plastic insert. For parachute recovery systems, it is now time to make your </big><br>
<big>parachute. </big></p>

<p align="left"><big>1. Secure a piece of plastic saran material (a bread sack works) for
the parachute. </big><br>
<big>Tissue paper form the hot air balloon module works excellent.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>2. Cut the parachute material in a octagon shape by using the
pattern. If you think</big><br>
<big>you need a larger parachute a larger pattern can be made (the larger the better).</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>3. Cut four lengths of lightweight string about 24 inches long.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>4. Using tape, tape each end of the string to each corner of the
octagon parachute.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>5. Gather the string loops and secure to the main fuselage.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>6. Attach the main fuselage to the transition cone or nose cone you
designed with </big><br>
<big>a heavier piece of string about 18 - 24 inches long.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>7. Tuck the strings and parachute between the main fuselage and nose
cone.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>8. Place the nose cone on top of the main fuselage. This should be a
loose fitting. </big><br>
<br>
<big>Your rocket is ready for launch.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Launching your Rocket</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>Choose a suitable launch site that is away from buildings, overhead
power lines </big><br>
<big>and level.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>The air should be calm for the launches.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>It is advisable that all bystanders keep a distance of 15 feet or
more away from </big><br>
<big>the launcher. In fact at about 25 feet away you will have a better view of the </big><br>
<big>launch.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>1. Fill your rocket with 4-10 ounces of water.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>2. While holding the rocket upside down, Place the &quot;O&quot; ring
into the mouth of the </big><br>
<big>body.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>3. Set your rocket, with the nose cone skyward, into the proper place
on the Hydro </big><br>
<big>Launcher. Slide the latch of the Hydro Launcher forward until fully engaged on the</big><br>
<big>locking pins.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>4. Make any final adjustments on the ping pong ball nose cone, making
sure the string </big><br>
<big>is not tangled.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>5. Install CO2 cartridge into the cartridge chamber.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>6. Slowly turn the thimble until the cartridge is punctured. The
water in your </big><br>
<big>rocket will begin to bubble at this point.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>7. Stay behind the protective shield while launching your rocket.</big><br>
<br>
<big>8. Count down from 5 to 1 thus indicating a planned launch.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>9. Pull the line that is attached to the latch on the Hydro Launcher.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>10. Observe the flight of Your rocket. If possible record the </big><br>
<big>altimeter.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>11. Time your rockets flight using a stop watch.</big></p>

<p align="left"><big>12. After reaching its apogee, the properly designed rocket will
tumble back to earth. </big><br>
<big>If a parachute recovery system is used, the rocket should separate and float back to </big><br>
<big>earth.</big></p>
