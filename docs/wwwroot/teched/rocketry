Heavier Than Air TransportationRocketryAerospace technology is the study of the technology used to design, build and fly airplanes, helicopters, missiles, rockets, spacecraft and related items. It also includes the study of the information produced by these items. A subdivision of aerospace technology is aeronautics. Aeronautics is the science of flying through the atmosphere. It involves designing, building, testing, and operating aircraft.This module focuses on the area of aerospace technology related to rocketry. A rocket is a device that carries its own supply of fuel and oxygen for combustion. It can operate in an environment that contains no air. Rockets have used to power a variety of vehicles. Spacecraft, missiles, boats, and automobiles have all been powered by rockets.Early HistoryRemember the last time you looked up at the star filled night sky? Did you ever wonder what it would be like to travel to a distant planet or solar system? You would not be alone, if you dreamed of such things. Since the beginning of time, humans have wondered about the vastness of the universe and the stars, planets and moons that fill it. Rockets are the oldest form of self-contained vehicles in existence. Forerunners to the rocket were in use more than a thousand years ago. Over a long and exciting history, rockets have evolved into mighty vehicles capable of launching a spacecraft that can travel out into the galaxy beyond our solar system.One of the first devices to employ the principles essential to rocket flight successfully was a wooden bird. According to legend, a Greek name Archyas amused the citizens of Tarentum with a flying pigoen suspendend on wires and propelled by escaping steam.Three hundred years after the pigoen, another Greek, Hero , invented a similar rocket type device called a arolipile. Today we call this device a Hero engine. A fire below a rotating water kettle created a turbine type instrument.The Chinese developed the first means of letting people soar with the birds about 350 B.C. Their discovery of how to make kites large enough to lift people into the air is similar to modern day hang gliding. The first rockets appeared in China about 1000. They were made by tying tubes to long shafts (similar to the bottle rockets of today. The tube contained early forms of gunpowder. Rockets during this period were not meant to harm the enemy, but to scare and confuse the horses and men with loud explosions. In mid-thirteenth century, trade routes established during earlier times, carried word of gunpowder and rockets to the Middle East and Europe. Over the next five hundred years the development of the rocket was slow. The ratio of chemical used in gunpowder were refined. Fins were added to the rocket for greater stability. An important step in the development of the rocket was made by Conrad Hass in 1532. His ideas on staging (a series of gunpowder filled tubes) allowed rockets to travel greater distances. By the end of the nineteenth century the use of rockets had given way to artillery and rifles.Up until 1926 all rockets had been powered by solid fuel (gunpowder). In March of that year, Dr.  Robert Goddard successfully flew the first liquid powered (gasoline and oxygen) rocket. The rocket rose to a height of 41 feet and fell to earth 172 feet from the point of take off. For his success, Dr. Goddard is known as the “father of the rocket”. From this seemingly unimpressive beginning modern aerospace technology began.Major advancements in rocket technology were made by German scientists during World War II. Lead by Dr. Wernher von Braun, German scientists designed, built and flew rockets that carried one ton of explosive over 190 miles. The German rocket known as the V-2 dropped from the skies over England causing death and destruction. After the war, many German scientists came to the United States and continued their research on rockets. From these men came the foundation for the space program we know today.Modern HistoryOn October 4, 1957, the former Soviet Union began the space age. That was the date on which Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, was placed in orbit around the earth. The United States of America, launched their own rocket twelve days after Sputnik 1. The American rocket placed the first object into orbit around the sun. Less than three months later, the first living animal, a dog called Laika, was carried by Sputnik 2 into orbit around the earth. The great space race between the United States and the then Soviet Union had begun.Yuri Gagarin, of the Soviet Air Force, was the first man in space. In April 1961, he made a complete trip around the earth and landed back on the earth again. Alan Shepard became the first American in space in May of 1961. During the next few years, several manned vehicles with two or more astronauts were sent up. In 1965 both Soviet and American astronauts performed “spacewalks”. A spacewalk is when the astronaut steps out of the spacecraft and walks in space.One of the greatest events in modern aerospace history started on July 20, 1969 with the lift off of Apollo 11 from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Apollo 11 carried three men, Neil Armstrong, Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. Four days after lift off, Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. Armstrong’s first step onto the moon marked a “giant leap” forward in technology. But just as great a leap was the technological achievement that was taking place back on earth at the same time. Live television coverage and world wide transmission of the events on the moon allowed people all over the world to view history in the making.In the early 1970’s, United States engineers began working on developing a reusable spacecraft. This became a reality when the Space Shuttle Columbia was launched in April 1981. With the introduction of the space shuttle came the ability to launch payloads from the shuttle cargo bay. The shuttle also allows the recovery of malfunctioning satellites, repairing them in the shuttle cargo bay, and then relaunching them back into space. This process was achieved in December of 1983 when the crew of the Space Shuttle Discovery recovered, repaired and relaunched the Hubble Space Telescope.This may be a good time to further explore the space shuttle and view the video that is part of this module.  There are some questions on your worksheet that can be answered from the video.Impacts of Aerospace technologyIn 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was formed. This organization has been responsible for the research and development of all aspects of aerospace technology. Many areas have been impacted by their research. Some areas are: Video and photo technology, energy systems design, fabric manufacture, air conditioning, biomedical advances, automotive design, electrical circuitry and pollution control.SpinoffsOut lives have been drastically changed by the research and development done by the aerospace program. Many of the inventions and conveniences of the modern world have been influenced by the work of scientists, engineers and technicians working for aerospace industries. The demands of the space program have caused computers to become smaller and faster. Computers are used for guidance and control of spacecraft as well as for communication systems. Much of what we know today of computers and computer related electronics came as a result of the space program. The need to save space and weight in space vehicles brought rapid advances in microelectronics. Mircoelectronics is the technology that deals with miniaturization of electronic circuits. Some of the benefits from miniature electronics that we now have are, miniature tv’s, portable computers, video recorders, electronic ignition of vehicles and video games.The area of material technology has benefitted by research done by NASA. In the search of lighter and stronger materials, NASA has developed new fabrics, composites and graphite materials. These materials are found in tennis rackets, fishing poles, snow skies, running shoes, airplane, and vehicle construction and clothing.Aerospace technology has provided ways to keep cars, homes and commercial builds warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. A reflective film was designed to protect manned spacecraft from solar radiation. Today, sheets of the same material are put on windows to keep out the sunlight and heat during summer and trap the heat in buildings during the winter. This same material is found in space “blankets” which can be used in emergencies to keep people warm.NASA has done a great deal of research in the area of robotics. This research has lead manufacturers to improve robot capabilities. One such use has been in voice controlled wheel chair for paralyzed and severely handicapped persons. The computer then translates the command into an electrical signal which activates the correct motors to make the wheel chair move.Principles of FlightThere are many things that affect the flight of a rocket. Among these are Newton’s Laws of Motion, the way the rocket is designed and built, and the forces of thrust, gravity, drag and lift. In 1687, an English scientist, Sir Isaac Newton published a book as the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Newton stated three laws of physics that defined the motion behind moving objects. The three laws of motion, described below , have been rewritten with regards to rocketry.First Law of MotionWhen a rocket moves through a vacuum (no friction or gravity) it will continue to move in the same direction and with the same speed until another force changes its direction and speed.Second Law of MotionThe amount of force that a rocket engine needs to produce lift and move is equal to the weight of the rocket and the speed at which it flies.Third Law of MotionThe thrust (pushing force) that a rocket engines causes the rocket to move in a direction opposite that of the thrust.The three laws of motion can be linked together in the following manner. If the rocket engine produces enough power, after it is ignited, the rocket will lift off and accelerate (second law). The direction the rocket travels is opposite to the direction in which the engine is pointed (third law). The rocket will continue in taht direction and with the same speed until another force changes the direction and speed (first law).Newton’s laws not only apply to rockets, but to every moving object.Component parts of a RocketRockets, whether they are full size or models, vary in their appearence, fueled by air pressure, solid fuel, or liquid fuel have the same basic parts. The parts in the figures have the following functions.The nose cone gives the rocket an aerodynamic shape. This reduces drag as the rocket flies. The nose cone may also carry the payload.The recovery system is how the rocket is recovered when it falls back to the surface of the earth. reliable recovery systems include tumble, parachute, glider, streamer, helicopter, featherweight and break-apart systems.The body tube or fuselage is the largest part of a rocket. It houses the recovery system and engine(s).The launch lug is used on some rockets to hold the model rocket on the launch pad and give the rocket stability in take off until the rocket has enough speed so the fins can take over the steering of the rocket. Fins guide the rocket and keep it flying straight after lift off.The engine holder is used on some rockets to hold the engine(s) withing the body tube.The engine provides the power needed to cause the rocket to lift off and accelerate.Forces Acting on a FlightThere are severel forces that effect the flight of a rocket. You will be operating a computer program on the Apple IIe which will allow you to become familiar with these terms. As you go through the computer program write down the definitons of these terms and place them in your notebook.The Physics of Model Rocketry	A computer program1.

Take your time follow drections and do the best job you can. Accuracy and neatness are important. You will be build a model water rocket. the material you will need are listed below. All material should be located in the cabinet you are sitting at.	Hot melt gun			Sandpaper	Hot glue sticks			Xacto knife	Permenent marker		White school glue	Transparent tape		Pattern for transition cone	Scissors				Pattern for fins	Masking tape			Large dowel for air tube	Cardboard			Plastic insert	Empty soda bottle 20 oz. 	Tag board	Ping Pong ball			Piece of glass	String				Streamer materialAt the end of this module you will be able to keep your rocket and take it home.Some things that you will supply on your own is paint, decals, stickers. A bottle would be nice, the teacher normally can’t drink enough soda to supply everyone with a soda bottle. Lets get started!1. Obtain a 20 oz. soda bottle, a larger bottle such as a 1 liter bottle also works well. A 2 liter bottle gets mighty heavy by the time you are finished. Remember, the greater the mass the greater the drag force and the less acceleration.  Make sure your bottle will fit into the launcher. Some bottle manufacturers use smaller molds and addition sanding steps are required before these bottles will fit. Some bottles have ridges inside the neck of the bottle, these will have to be ground down smooth.What type of recovery system do you want on your rocketThink about the type of recovery system you would like to build into your rocket. If  you decide on a tumble recovery, continue on.  If you decide on use a streamer system, continue on, then  place the streamer material on the string between the plastic insert and the ping pong ball (step 25).  If you decide to use the parachute method, step number 8 will be done differently depending upon your design (see figure below)2. Rinse the bottle with cold water, and seal with the cap. When the bottle warms the air inside will pressurize slightly and the bottle will be easier to work with.You may also use a pressure pump to add pressure to you bottle3. Obtain the paper measuring tape supplied in the drawer. You will use it to determine where the fins will be placed.4. Place the measuring tape around the bottle, just above where the circumference tapers. This is approximately 2  3/8 from the end (cap).5. Using a permenent marker indicate thelocation for each fin. Make a mark at the 3”, 6”, and 9” points.6. To make vertical lines for the fin placement,hold the bottle up against a door frame(see illustration).7. Use the permenent to draw the placement markings. Make these lines about 2” long.8. Lightly sand the inside of the bottle feet where the air tube will fit. sanding will allow the glue to stick better. If you are using  parachute method and a carboard transition cone skip this step. If  you are using a partial bottle for the transition cone lightly sand the fett on this section.9. Lightly sand the marked areas where the fins will be placed.10. Obtain the air tube and trim it to size.  Glue the air tube to the bottles “feet” using hot glue. If you are designing a parachute recovery system, the air tube will be place on the transition cone only (step 17). Another bottle (lower part) could be used.11. Place the bottle in the holding fixture and set aside for a while.12. There are many types and designs for the fins. Choose the style of fins you would like, or design your own.13. Cut out the fin pattern with scissors. Trace around the pattern on to a piece of thick cardboard. Will need three fins.14. Carefully cut out the fins out using a xacto knife. Cut on the piece of glass. Do not cut on the counter top. Take several cuts do not try and cut the fin out with one pass of the knife.15. With the bottle in the holding device, glue the air tube to the bottles’ bottom. Make sure the air tube is properly aligned.16. Use the hot glue to attach the fins to the bottle. Do not apply the glue to the bottle. you could melt through the bottle and your rocket will be ruined. Make sure they are aligned properly.17. Trace around the transistion cone pattern on to a piece  of constrution paper of your choice. Cut out the transistion cone from a piece of thin tag board. If you are using a larger or smaller than normal soda bottle, you may have to design your own transistion cone.18. Roll it in your hand to give the cone some shape.19. Form the cone over your rocket and secure the cone with transparent tape (you may need some help with this step).20. Use hot glue to secure the cone to the rocket. Be careful not to melt through the bottle.21. Allow the glue to cool.22. You may decorate your rocket as you choose. You will have to supply your own paint, decals or stickers. Be creative, making your rocket look as realistic as possible.23. The ping pong ball is the nose cone for your rocket. If the ball is not attached to a piece of string, you may attach it now. Do not melt through the ball.24. If the string is not threaded through the plastic insert, tied, and glued you may do this now.25. Carefully ease the plastic insert into the end of the air tube. If it is loose, put some tape around the insert to snug it up. If the plastic insert does not fit, make two slits in the tube with sissors on opposite sides to spread the tube. Then seal the plastic insert to the tube with tape.26. Make sure that the string, attached to the ball is not tangled. If you are using the streamer recovery system, tie about 12 inches of streamer material midway between the  plastic insert and the ping pong ball.  Place the ball on top of the plastic insert. For parachute recovery systems, it is now time to make your parachute. 1.  Secure a piece of plastic saran material (a bread sack works) for the parachute. Tissue paper form the hot air balloon module works excellent2.  Cut the parachute material in a octagon shape by using the pattern. If you think you need a larger parachute a larger pattern can be made.3.  Cut four lengths of lightweight string about 18 inches long.4. Using tape, tape each end of the string to each corner of the octagon parachute.5. Gather the string loops and secure to the main fuselage.6. Attach the main fuselage to the transition cone or nose cone you designed with a heavier piece of string about 12 - 18 inches long.7. Tuck the strings and parachute between the main fuselage and nose cone.8.  Place the nose cone on top of the main fuselage. This should be a loose fitting. Your rocket is ready for launch.Launching your RocketChoose a suitable launch site that is away from buildings, overhead power lines and level.The air should be calm for the launches.It is advisable that all bystanders keep a distance of 15 feet or more away from the launcher. In fact at about 25 feet away you will have a better view of the launch.1. Fill your rocket with 4-10 ounces of water.2. While holding the rocket upside down, Place the “O” ring into the mouth of the body.3. Set your rocket, with the nose cone skyward, into the proper place on the Hydro Launcher. Slide the latch of the Hydo Launcher forward until fully engaged on the locking pins.4. Make any final adjustments on the ping pong ball nose cone, making sure the string is not tangled.5. Install CO2 cartridge into the cartridge chamber.6. Slowly turn the thimble untill the cartridge is punctured. The water in your rocket will begin to bubble at this point.7. Stay behind the protective shield while launching your rocket.8. Count down from 5 to 1 thus indicating a planned launch.9. Pull the line that is attached to the latch on the Hydro Launcher.10. Observe the flight of  Your rocket. If possible record the measurments with the altimeter.11.  Time your rockets flight using a stop watch.12. After reaching its apogee, the properly designed rocket will tumble back to earth. If a parachute recovery system is used, the rocket should separate and float back to earth.Launch ReportName ____________________________________________________________Date _____________________________________________________________Rocket DataSize of bottle used ________________________________________________Height of rocket __________________________________________________Weight of rocket without water ____________________________________Weather DataTime of day ______________________________________________________Temperature _____________________________________________________Weather conditions  (be specific_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Flight DataAmount of water used ____________________________________________Height rocket reached at its zenith _________________________________Length of time your rocket was aloft _______________________________Describe your rockets flight _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Describe your rockets landing ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________What kind of damage did your rocket recieve? _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Were you able to launch your rocket more than once? ______________
