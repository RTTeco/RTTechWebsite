CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY<br>
THE GEODESIC DOME</p>

<p align="left">Look around and think about all the houses, office buildings, schools,
roads, bridges, factories, and dams that people have built, or constructed. Can you name
some other structures? How much do you know about building structures? In this booklet you
will learn about the production of larger products such as houses and bridges. The
construction projects categories are commercial, residential, and civil. An example of a
commercial project would be a warehouse, a store or mall. An example of residential
construction is obvious, houses and apartments, condos etc. An example of civil
construction would be a road, a bridge, or interstate highway, projects that benefit many
people. You will be able to construct a model of a geodesic home. The construction
industry uses materials, money, land and technology to produce the buildings and other
structures you're used to seeing. Construction is a large and complex industry that
affects you in many ways. Most people think of construction as building houses.
Construction also gives us structures like highways, airports, tunnels, to name a few.
Sometimes structures are important for their design or historical meaning like the
Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial. Most of the time, we design buildings and
structures to meet a special need. In the beginning, people needed a shelter. Early
shelters were caves or structures made mostly of animal skins, twigs, branches, mud, or
anything natural that people could find. As people started to settle in one place, they
needed more permanent dwellings. They needed shelters that wouldn't blow over in a strong
wind and that could withstand different kinds of seasonal weather. Though no one knows the
name of the world's first structural engineer, humans learned to build some amazing
structures in early history even without machinery and iron tools. Have you seen pictures
of the pyramids? The Great Pyramid at Gizeh, Egypt, was built in 2600 B.C. From huge
limestone blocks cut with copper chisels and saws. The people who built it had no mortar
or cement, so the entire pyramid is held together only by the weight of the stones. Later,
the Romans built huge arenas, bridges, dams, aqueducts, and temples to serve their needs.
You can visit many of these structures today. By the nineteenth century, new materials
changed the ways structures could be built. High quality steel, developed by Sir Henry
Bessemer in 1854, made it possible to build structures that were stronger, more reliable,
and lasted longer. Then new concrete that could be poured and would set under water were
developed. Concrete combined with steel made reinforced concrete that had the best
properties of both materials. Today, plastics, fiberglass, and improved metals enable
architects and structural engineers to build even better and stronger structures. Better
sources of power and new technologies also have helped the construction industry move
ahead. Construction technology is a very important part of today's economy. To understand
construction in today's society, we should take a look at how much construction has taken
place in recent years. The way we, in the United States, measure goods and services
produced is by the GNP (Gross National Product). We can say that if you bought everything
that was produced in one year, it would cost you the amount of the GNP. Construction
accounts for about 16% of this amount. This means that it would cost you about 900 billion
dollars to buy everything that was constructed in 1990. Sixteen cents out of every dollar
spent each year is spent to buy such things as homes roads, bridges and dams. You can see
that construction technology is a very important part of our society. Do you think
construction will continue at such a rapid pace in the future? Is man's need for
constructed things increasing? In the past one hundred years there has been a great
increase in home construction. To meet our needs and wants, great factories have been
constructed at a rapid rate. Office buildings increase in number and size to house
services we want. Miles of roads and bridges are constructed yearly to make it easier for
us to travel and to transport products more rapidly. The trend would seem to indicate a
continued growth in the field of construction to meet the ever new needs and wants of our
ever growing population. Anything built on a site is a result of construction technology
(knowing how to use tools and techniques to build something on a site). We know that if
man did not exist, there would be no construction technology as we know it. You might ask
yourself, &quot;How do we get all the structures that we see around us?&quot; First,
someone has to want the structure at a certain place. Would anything be built if nobody
wanted it or was willing to pay for it? Once someone wants and is willing to pay for
something, it must be designed and developed. Thus a plan for action is developed. Then a
sequence (the step) to be followed during construction is prepared so that the
construction will be completed as planned. Then the services of many different skilled
people must be contracted. A plan is submitted or given to contractors who can handle most
of the steps of building a structure. The contractors bid on the job and the bid of the
least amount of money usually is selected. Once a contractors firm has been chosen to
construct the object, how does the firm begin? First the location or where the object is
to be built must be chosen. Then the site must be prepared. If a dam is to be constructed,
water might have to be rechanneled so that the men can reach the bedrock to begin
construction. In building a house, trees might have to be removed the ground leveled, and
earth removed to make a place for the foundation. You can see that no matter what you are
building, the site must be prepared in some way. After the site is prepared, the structure
must be built. Because of the many different things involved in building most structures,
many people with special skills are needed. Because of the specialization of techniques or
skills, we can build greater structures for less money. After the structure is built, the
site must be finished, landscaping (the finishing touches). The materials are cleaned up,
shrubbery and trees are put in place to add beauty; and lighting, roads, sidewalks, and
other things are installed to make the site ready to use. The constructed object is the
complete. All constructed objects must be continually maintained due to wear by use or
deterioration from weather or corrosion. This is a part of (servicing). The geodesic
structure is a particular type of dome. The word &quot;geodesic&quot; (earth divide) means
to divide the shape of a sphere such as the earth into exact points. This dome is divided
into geometric patterns. Triangles, pentagons, and hexagons interlock to create a
structure far stronger than one would expect. In fact, the geodesic dome can withstand
pressure from above many times greater than can a regular dome or the conventional roof
design with a minimum of energy /material. Geodesic homes are also lightweight and easy to
assemble. Domes maximize volume while minimizing surface area. They are energy efficient
as architectural structures by retaining heat, while minimizing solar heat load. All
structures, no matter what their shape of function, are in a game of tug of war, with
nature's forces on one side and the strength of the structure design and materials on the
other. Structural engineers have to plan structures that have enough strength to with
stand a sudden gust of wind, an extreme increase in temperature, and earthquake, the pull
to gravity, and even the wearing effects of water. Geodesic domes are strong because their
design balances the forces of compression, tension, and shear. Dome designs minimize drag
and distribute wind and or snow loads (live loads). Forces that causes material to be
squeezed together is called compression. A standing column is always under compression.
That's why steel and concrete are the best materials for withstanding compression.
Tension, on the other hand, is the stress that pulls materials apart. Tension is the main
force at work in steel cables of a suspension bridge or the inflated domes of some
stadiums. Shear is a sliding force. The blades of a scissors cut through paper by forcing
it in opposite directions as the blades slide by each other. This is an example of shear
stress. The unique arrangement of triangles in the dome evenly distributes the forces and
creates a balance. Making it exceptionally strong. Each triangle supports the adjoining
triangles. In your cardboard dome, the 40 triangles of two sizes create a strong durable
structure. And last but not least, they're just darn pretty to look at! Much of the
development for the geodesic dome is credited to the brilliant U.S. Many cultures have
developed complex spheroid designs used for woven bowls, hats and even structures. The
Greeks were the first to record mathematical models of geodesic forms. They created
polyhedrons (seven or more sided shapes), icosahedrons (twenty sides shapes), dodecahedrons
(12 equal sided shapes). It was the Romans who first used geodesic framing to build
concrete domes. In the 1920's, a German scientist/engineer, Walter Bauersfeld, created the
first metal reinforced, concrete geodesic dome. This was used to house the first
planetarium, created by Zeiss Optical Works in Jena, Germany. In the 1940's, designer,
mathematician, and philosopher, Richard Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) adopted the Greek's
icosahedrons to produce his geodesic dome for use in architectural structures. He pioneered
unusual ideas in car and housing design. His creations were ahead of his time. He believed
the triangle to be far superior to the rectangle typically used in product design. This
was demonstrated in his unique 3 wheeled cars, geodesic domes and dymaxion Dwelling
Machine, a portable house in a geodesic dome style. The geodesic dome is used for houses,
sports stadiums, temporary structures and planetariums. Several famous geodesics have
served as the central building for World Fairs. The domes unique design still evokes
impressions of buildings of the future. Also, its round shape is a pleasant change in our
modern world of rectangle, hard edged houses. While Fuller's work on geodesic domes
produced quite a bit of excitement among young engineers particularly during the late
1960's and early 70's &quot;earth movement&quot;. The geodesic dome fell far short of the
expectations that many had placed on it. There are several reasons for this
failure:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dome designs are rarely accepted in suburban planning
schemes.&nbsp; Conventional furnishings and fixtures do not fit well in curved spaces.
reducing&nbsp; spatial efficiency. Because there are few horizontal and vertical planes,
most conventional architectural framing will members will not work.</p>

<p align="center">Lets get started:</p>

<p align="left">When you're building anything, you need to remember how important the
loads and other stresses on the structure are. It is important to plan for these before
you start the actual building process.</p>

<p align="left">BUILD YOUR OWN GEODESIC DOME</p>

<p align="left">Supplies you will need:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Coloring pencils, pens, crayons or markers<br>
Scissors&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Xacto knife&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Ruler or straight edge<br>
Rubber cement</p>

<p align="left">General directions or notes&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Do not color the flaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to score the dotted lines first
in order to make better folds. For a permanent bond, apply rubber cement to both surfaces
to be glued.&nbsp;For a non permanent or temporary bond, apply rubber cement to one
surface only.</p>

<p align="left">Directions to build your geodesic dome home&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">Color flat patterns in any design you choose. Do not color on the flaps.
Cut along the outside edge of the patterns with scissors on the solid lines. Score the
dotted lines on the opposite side of the pattern sheet using an Xacto knife. Do not cut
all the way through the patterns. Be careful not to cut yourself. </p>

<p align="left">Fold on the dotted lines.</p>

<p align="left">To construct the dome</p>

<p align="left">To put the dome parts together, match the symbols together. Start with #1
flap that has the symbol . Match this flap with the edge that has the same&nbsp; symbol.
Apply rubber cement. Fit edges carefully and press together. Find the #2 flap with its
symbol. Match this flap with the edge that has the same&nbsp; symbol. Fit edges carefully
and press well together.&nbsp; Do the same for flap #3, #4, #5 and so
on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work from the bottom of the home to the top. The top of your basic
geodesic home should now be complete. </p>

<p align="left">Working with the floor plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Cut along the outside edge of the patterns with scissors on the solid
lines. Assemble the three pieces of the floor plan with rubber cement. Identify the rooms
of your dome by placing a label in that room. </p>

<p align="left">Experiments and other activities. </p>

<p align="left">After your dome is complete, test the strength of the structure by
pressing down on its top with the palm of your hand. Compare this to a rectangular
cardboard&nbsp; box which would collapse from the outside weight of your hand. &nbsp;Cut
out windows and doors by removing some triangles or part of the dome.&nbsp; Notice the
door window locations on the floor plans. Build an entrance with a triangular shaped
tunnel.&nbsp;Create and design the second floor or loft of your dome home. Include space
for the stairway etc. Create additional rooms to enlarge the existing dome home with more
triangles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that two different shaped triangles are used in this
structure. One triangle&nbsp; is equilateral (3 sides equal) and the other is isosceles (2
equal sides). Experiment with triangles and truss structures to build your own
creative&nbsp; structures. Add a cardboard base to your home. Create a deck and add
landscaping and&nbsp; other features to your dome home. Using the trees and shrubs in the
booklet.</p>
