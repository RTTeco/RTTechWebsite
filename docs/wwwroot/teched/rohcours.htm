<p>PRINCIPLES OF TECHNOLOGY COURSE DESCRIPTION</p>

<p>Principles of Technology is a SEMESTER COURSE designed to prepare students
for technical careers. Today's technicians must understand the principles and
systems on which modern equipment operates. Understanding these topics enables
technicians to adapt to new tasks as the need arises. This applied science and
math course uses videotape and hands on&nbsp; activities as the major components
of instruction. Principles of
Technology is a course in applied science for those who plan to
purse careers as technicians or who just want to keep pace with
the advances in technology. It blends an understanding of basic
principles with practice in practical applications. It will give
you a firm foundation for understanding today is and tomorrows
technology. The students will focus on one of the important
concepts that under grid modern technology. Concepts will include
force, work, rate, resistance, power and energy. In each unit
that concept will be applied to mechanical devices, electrical
devices, fluid devices, and thermal devices. </p>
