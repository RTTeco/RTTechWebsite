<p align="center">EXPLORING TECHNOLOGY<br>
ROBOTICS AND ROBOTIC PROGRAMMING</p>

<p>Movies and television cartoons often portray robots. Many times these media images do
not match with reality. Just a few years ago, a robot invasion seemed ready to displace
humans in factories, take over office tasks, and maybe even run the business. Of course
the invasion hasn't occurred. In retrospect, the projected image of robots surpassing
humans in all characteristics was just that, and imagination. In real life most robots are
industrial robots. The roots of their development lie in the effort to automate some or
all of the operations required on the factory floor. Many businesses today employ robots.
Robots work at a variety of tasks, Some robots sort parts for manufacturing. A great
number of robots do welding. Robots are used in underwater and space exploration.<br>
In the United States most industrial robots are employed in automobile plants. They work
alongside people building cars. They are involved in a number of processes. Robots are
used for palletizing where they lift and stack materials for shipment. Robots handle hot
metals in the forging and foundry processes. They weld in difficult positions without
resting. Since they never tire, their work is accurate. Since they never fool around or
waste effort, they are efficient workers too. Robots in industry are truly a benefit. They
assist people in factories to make or produce more goods, cheaper and easier. Economists
call this &quot;increased productivity&quot;. While robots can do many useful jobs, we
must remember that all robots are machines. Machines are designed by people to serve human
needs. As machines, all robots are controlled by people. Machines differ for people in
important ways. They do not think, dream, image, sleep, eat, feel emotions or have
desires. Very few robots resemble human beings physically either. Some are very big and
other are very small. They rarely have faces or complete bodies, because they don't need
all the human body parts for their jobs. As humans go, robots are a disappointment. But as
production machines, robots are increasingly proving themselves as cost effective tools.
Robotics engineers design various robots to do classes of tasks efficiently. So, a robot
designed for working as a fixed station would not have wheels or legs for moving itself
around. <br>
Robots consist of four basic components. The manipulator, the controller, the power
supply, and the end of arm tooling. The manipulator is the &quot;arm&quot; of the robot. <br>
Designed much like the human arm, it takes its name. Robots have a &quot;wrist&quot;
attached to the end of the arm. The wrist provides the angular orientation of the work
piece as the arm positions the wrist in space.<br>
The controller performs the complex computations for control of the robots joints to the
proper positions and velocity so that the end of the arm follows the assigned path at the
assigned speed. The controller also monitors the feedback signals from the robot's joints
and actuators. True robots did not become possible until the invention of the computer in
the 1940's and the progressive miniaturization of computer parts to build these complex
controllers. <br>
The power supply may be hydraulic, electric, or pneumatic depending upon the particular
robot. Today most robots being introduced have electric drives.<br>
The end of arm tooling is attached to the robot wrist and consists of a device that is
application specific. This can be a gripper to close around parts, a tool holder for a
welding head, an automatic screwdriver and so on. Additionally, most robot installations
require other devices to position the work, deliver the parts to a particular spot for the
robot to pick up, monitor safety, or secure the work piece during processing, this is call
peripheral tooling.<br>
The following is the definition of the term &quot;robot&quot; used by the Robot
Institution of America.<br>
<strong>A reprogramable multi-functional manipulator designed to move material, parts,
tools, or specialized devices, through variable programmed motions for the performance of
a variety of tasks.</strong><br>
Since this is a complex definition, lets break it into parts:<br>
<br>
1. Reprogramable means something that can be given a set of computer instructions more <br>
that once. After programming it can be erased and given a different set of instructions.<br>
<br>
2. Multi-functional means something that can do more than one kind of work.</p>

<p>3. Manipulator means someone or something that handles another thing or works in by
hand <br>
or mechanically.</p>

<p>4. Variable refers to something that can change or be changed.</p>

<p>Factors for Consideration in Robot Applications</p>

<p>Safety - Safety is a consideration when determining whether to employ a robot or person
for a given job. Some materials are unsafe for people to handle or to be exposed to, such
as hazardous chemicals, radioactive material, medical waste, poisonous substances, highly
flammable materials, very hot or very cold materials. Robots can be designed which are
unaffected by these substances.<br>
Certain environments where work must be done are dangerous for people or they cannot live
in them at all. Deep underwater, outer space, frigid areas, very hot places, contaminated
or polluted areas are not safe for people. Robots can be designed which are unaffected by
these conditions.</p>

<p>Economics - The economics or cost of replacing a human worker with a robot is another
consideration. Robots are generally very expensive to purchase, but they entail lower
overhead costs than a human worker. For example, robots do not require wages, or a heated,
well lit room in which to work, or vacations. Robot require maintenance, but not health
insurance or holidays. People require paid salary, unlike robots. However a robot will
eventually wear out, and new one must be purchased. Robots do not get tired as people do,
and so they can work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Very often in
industry the decision to employ a robot involves an economic decision.</p>

<p>Accuracy - People are not machines. Their muscles tire and they tremble when holding
the same position becomes uncomfortable for them. People cannot repeat exactly the same
motion as often as robots with the same degree of accuracy. In certain applications such
as welding overhead or performing delicate surgery, a robot's accuracy will greatly exceed
that of a person.</p>

<p>Capability - Robots are not people. Although they can be stronger than people, never
tire, and are imperious to harsh environments or hazardous materials, there are many human
capabilities they do not possess. They cannot discover people's feelings or express
concern for them or make judgments about people's intentions. Some jobs require awareness
of and attention to people's thoughts, feelings, and problems. Robots can not change their
programming in order to do jobs which are unpredictable and require higher order thinking
skills to accomplish.</p>

<p>The term robot itself is derived from the Czech word robota, meaning &quot;compulsory
labor&quot;. It was first used in the 1921 play R.U.R (which stands for &quot;Rossum's
Universal Robots&quot;) by the Czech novelist and playwright Karel Capek, to describe a
mechanical device that looks like a human but, lacking the human sensibility, can perform
only automatic, mechanical operations. The term android is now generally reserved for
human like figures of this sort, ranging from robots than operate by electromechanical
means in order to perform human like functions.</p>

<p>The early industrial robots were first used for simple &quot;pick and place&quot;
operations, which included material handling and machine loading and unloading. As robot
technology improved, they have been successfully utilized in spot welding, die casting,
foundry, plastic molding, painting and finishing, and many other industrial processes.
Computers today are equipped with small microprocessors that can handle the data fed them
by various sensors of the surrounding environment. Making use of the principle of
feedback. The commercial use of robots is spreading , with the increasing automation of
factories, and they have long since become essential to many laboratory procedures. Japan
is in the forefront of nations exploring robot technology. Whether the androids of science
fiction will ever become reality is not yet possible to predict, because duplication of
even such seemingly simple acts as bipedal walking has proved to be very difficult. Robots
should continue to expand their applications; the roboarm that we have in our laboratory
may be one sign of the future.</p>

<p>There are many different types of robots designed for use in factories, schools and
homes. Robotics is a growing industry with new designs appearing constantly in the market.
One method of classifying robots is by the level of technology. A low technology robot has
a very limited number of program steps and no feed back. A high technology robot uses
electromechanical systems to provide accurate positioning and control about the robots
environment. The more axis the robot has the higher classification of the robot. The
work
envelope of a robot is the total three dimensional space within the gripper or end of arm
tooling of the robot can be positioned. The work cell involves the area in which the robot
performs tasks on or with other machines within a factory. The related machines can
include a wide variety of possibilities. Figure 1 shows the work envelope of a stationary
medium technology robot. Figure 2 shows the work envelope of jointed arm robot. Figure 3
shows the work cell of a robot and figure 4 shows the work cell of robots performing tasks
along side of humans.</p>

<p>Using The RoboArm Starting the program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>1. Plug the power supply and interface into a 110/120 volt ac outlet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ready light on the RoboArm should be Blinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>2. Double click, or open the file MacRobo. RoboArm first executes a self-diagnostic
routine. If it passes its test, RoboArm's introductory screen will display and then fade
away, to be followed by MAIN&nbsp;MENU. If RoboArm does not pass, the preceding sequence
will not occur. Instead, instructions will appear telling you how to enable RoboArm to
pass its test.&nbsp;Follow the instructions on the screen. </p>

<p>Did RoboArm pass its self test?</p>

<p>Yes? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;All right!&quot; </p>

<p>The MAIN MENU should now be on the screen. Lets proceed to the next page. FIVE AXES.</p>

<p>NO?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have followed the on screen instructions and RoboArm is
still unable to pass its self test , immediately call your instructor.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
