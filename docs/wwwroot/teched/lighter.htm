<p align="center">EXPLORING TECHNOLOGY<br>
AIR TRANSPORTATION</p>

<p>Probably the most inventive and imaginative transportation ideas have come in the field
of flight. For thousands of years, people wondered why birds could fly. Many attempts were
made by the Greeks and Chinese to discover ways to make people fly. The Greek legend of
Icarus describes how wings of feathers were strapped to his arms, and how he crashed to
his death. Even great inventors like Leonardo da Vinci thought people should be able to
fly by flapping some kind of a wing device. History is full of stories of birdmen who
tried to copy birds in flight, but were never able to turn their dreams into reality. What
really started air flight were dreams of going up into the sky, not a special need to
transport people or things somewhere else. People didn't think about how aircraft could
help them in the beginning. You can divide aircraft into lighter-than-air vehicles and
heavier-than-air vehicles. Lighter-than-air vehicles float in air depending on their
weight and volume. Heavier-than-air vehicles must supply power to fly. The first really
successful aircraft of any kind was the hot air balloon designed by Frenchmen Joseph and
Etienne Montgolfier in 1783. They did not know what really made their balloon go up. They
thought maybe some unknown, mysterious gas was released from burning wood! Do you know why
hot-air balloons go up? This principle of lighter-than-air flight was used in many more
designs as people experimented with hydrogen-filled and hot-air-filled balloons to carry
people up. Although the first flights were unmanned, they pointed the way to later flights
with ducks, chickens and sheep as passengers. Eventually on September 21, 1783 Pilatre de
Rozier and Marquis D'Arlandes became the first men to make an aerial journey, ascending in
a montgolfier-type balloon and flying over Paris for 25 minutes at an altitude of 3,000
feet. These hot-air balloons are one form of transportation. However, they are also used
for recreational purposes. The use of hot-air balloons has increased in the past few
years. In fact, many cities now have hot-air balloon contests for accuracy and distance of
flight. The technology is now affordable and can be learned easily. The balloon flies
because it is filled with hot air which is less dense than the air around it. When the air
in the balloon cools, it gets heavier and sinks. Hot air is put into the balloon from the
exhaust of large propane burners. Technologically, a hydrocarbon fuel is converted by
combustion into thermal energy. Once the balloon is aloft, the thermal energy inside is
lost to the outside. As this happens, the balloon slowly descends. Control of the position
and height of the balloon is determined by turning on the propane burners for a certain
length of time. Usually, someone tracks the balloon over the land to act as support when
is lands. </p>

<p align="center">HOT AIR BALLOONS</p>

<p>You and your partner are going to make a hot air balloon during this part of your
rotation. The materials you will need are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>12 sheets of tissue paper (approx. 20&quot; x 30&quot;)<br>
White glue<br>
Scissors<br>
Tape<br>
Straight pins (optional)<br>
The pattern<br>
Wire<br>
Construction paper<br>
Clothes pins</p>

<p align="center">Lets get started.</p>

<p>Step 1. You and your partner will be constructing one balloon as a team or you may each
construct one for yourself but you do need to work together. Select 12 pieces of tissue
paper from the supply in the classroom. You might want to consider some sort of color
scheme or arrangement of colors. The tissue paper measures about 20 inches by 30 inches.
When finished, make sure you leave the drawer in neat order.</p>

<p>Step 2. You are going to glue six pairs of two sheets together to form six large panels
approximately 20 inches by 60 inches. To have enough room to glue the panels together roll
out the tissue sheets and work in the manufacturing laboratory.</p>

<p>Step 3. Lay out two pieces of tissue on the work bench. Using white glue, put a
continuous small bead of glue about 1/4 inch from the edge of the 20 inch side. Overlap
the edged of the sheets and pat the glue area down. Remember you are trying to make six
large panels 20&quot; by 60&quot;. Your fingers will get sticky, so you may need a damp
paper towel to keep your hands clean. Lay the two sheets you have glued aside, and
continue gluing pairs together until you have six large panels. You need to be careful
that you do not get so much glue on the seam that it soaks through and sticks to the other
panels. You need to fold the panels carefully, and store them until the next class period.
See the instructor to place your sheets in storage.</p>

<p>Step 4. Clean up the glue from the work table and put any other equipment in its proper
place.</p>

<p>Step 5. When the six panels are dry, stack them on top of each other, and then lay the
pattern on top. The pattern is located in the same drawer as the tissue paper. You will
want to use approximately 8 straight pins to hold the pattern and the stack of tissue
paper together (optional). If the pattern is longer or wider than your stack of tissues do
not worry.</p>

<p>Step 6. Carefully cut around the pattern. If the pattern is larger than your tissue
continue to cut but adjust your balloon according to the size of your paper by following
the same radii and tapers.</p>

<p>Step 7. When you have cut out the entire shape, remove the straight pins. Fold the
pattern carefully and return it to the drawer. Keep a few sheets of tissue paper for the
top and for patching. Throw the rest in the trash. </p>

<p>Step 8. You are now ready to begin gluing the panels of your balloon together. You will
take 2 panels off your stack, place one on top of the other, so the bottom panel edge
extends 1/2 inch past the top panel.</p>

<p>Step 9. Fold the bottom panel edge up over the top, then unfold. Put a continuous bead
of glue 1/4 inch from the edge of the top panel and pat the tissue paper into the glue.</p>

<p>Step 10. Take panel 3 and place it on top of panel 2 so the opposite edge of panel 2 is
extended 1/2 inch. Again put a line of glue on the edge and fold over the edge of panel 2
and pat in onto the glue. Be careful not to use an excess amount of glue or the panel
might stick together where they should not. Continue until all six panels have been placed
on top and folded and glued. If you get caught with your balloon half glued together at
the end of the class period carefully fold it and place it in storage.</p>

<p>Step 11. Continue to place panels on top until all panels have been glued. If
you have
glued all but the last seam of the balloon, it is time to flip the whole stack over.</p>

<p>Step 12. Fold the inside glued edges back inside out of the way.</p>

<p>Step 13. Extend the bottom edge of panel 2 and 6 out 1/2 inch and put a thin line of
glue on the top edge about 1/4 inch in from the edge. Fold over the bottom and pat it into
the glued line. You should no have all edges of the six panels glued together.</p>

<p>Step 14. Cut a piece of tissue for the top. It can be any shape. A hexagon or octagon,
or a circle. Depending on how your balloon went together. Trace out and cut out a piece of
tissue from the few that you saved. This will be glued to the top of your balloon. Place a
coffee can inside your balloon and squeeze the balloon down around the can so the top of
your balloon is over the can. Apply a bead of glue and press the top of your balloon in
place</p>

<p>.Step 15. Obtain a piece of wire it is found in the same drawer as the rest of the
material.</p>

<p>Step 16. Form a hoop with the wire and tape the two ends together with black electrical
tape. Be careful so the wire does not spring free. This hoop will fit into the bottom of
your balloon. Place the hoop inside your balloon, apply a bead of glue round and fold the
bottom of your balloon over the hoop and pat the tissue in place to permanently trap the
hoop. Glue and work about three inches at a time as you glue and pat. Clothes pins help in
holding the wire in place.</p>

<p>Step 17. Obtain a piece of construction paper. Using the paper cutter, cut two strips
the long way about 2 inches wide. Tape the two strips together so they will be about 28
inches long. Fold the strip in half, so the strip is in a vee shape about 28&quot; long.</p>

<p>Step 18. Using a stapler, staple the vee shape strip over the bottom of your balloon
and hoop. This makes neat a looking edge.</p>

<p>Step 19. Obtain a piece of string at least 15 feet long if you would like a tether, and
with a paper punch, punch a hole through the construction paper and the balloon; tie one
end of the string to the balloon.</p>

<p>Step 20. Inspect your balloon for any holes or tears. Use the pieces of saved material
to patch your balloon. It would be a good idea to save these pieces in case you need them
in the future</p>

<p>.Step 21. You are now ready to launch your balloon.</p>

<p align="center">Launch Conditions</p>

<p>One thing to remember is that the greater the temperature difference between the
outside air and the heated air inside the balloon the higher your balloon will go. A
cool
crisp morning is the optimum for hot air balloon launches. The air must be calm for the
launch. The launch site should be level, well away from buildings, power lines, and water.</p>

<p align="center">Launching the Balloon</p>

<p>Step 1. Construct your hot air balloon as described in the module written material.</p>

<p>Step 2. Review these Safety Considerations.</p>

<p>Make sure you notify the instructor before launching your balloon.</p>

<p>While most of the launcher will be cool to the touch, students should&nbsp;be cautioned
that the grill near the top of the launcher chimney is very hot while the launcher is lit.</p>

<p>Student should never lean over the launcher while it is lit.</p>

<p>A fire extinguisher should be on site when operating the launcher.</p>

<p>This unit uses propane cylinders as a fuel source. Store propane&nbsp; canisters
away
from sources of heat and sparks.</p>

<p>Balloon fabric is flammable. Avoid overheating by keeping the fabric&nbsp;away&nbsp;
from the hot air exhaust.&nbsp;The launcher should be operated outdoors only. </p>

<p>It is advisable that all students, except those involved in launching, keep a safe
distance of at least 10 feet from the launcher.</p>

<p>Step 3. Have igniter ready as you open the flow valve slightly. Insert the lighter into
the hole in the side of the chimney of the launcher, and squeeze the trigger to ignite the
gas within the launcher. Open the valve fully.</p>

<p>Step 4. Have two students securely grasp the bottom of the balloon with their finger
tips. The top of the balloon should be held up by a third student if needed.</p>

<p>Step 5. The students then quickly position the opening of the balloon over the top of
the balloon launcher. The top of the balloon should be held as high as possible over the
launcher until the balloon is sufficiently full of hot air to keep its shape.</p>

<p>Step 6. Students should keep a good grasp on the balloon until it is completely full of
hot air.</p>

<p>Step 7. Once the pull from the buoyant hot air is steady and strong, release the
balloon into the air. </p>

<p>Step 8. When finished, shut the flow valve to turn off the launcher. Step 9. Unscrew the
propane canister and store the launcher and the propane safely.</p>

<p>Step 10. Fill out your launch report.</p>

<p>Make a list of personalities you have read and learned about doing this module.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">TISSUE BALLOON PATTERN (For instructors)</p>

<p>To make pattern for the balloon get a piece of paper 2 feet x 5 feet long</p>

<p>Butcher paper works, two sheets of tag board also works.</p>

<p>Fold the paper lengthwise in half.</p>

<p>On the folded edge, measure off and mark every 6 inches from the bottom to the top. At
the six inch locations, measure the distance from the edge and place a mark according to
the following schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>0&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3
1/2&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>6&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 1/2&quot;</p>

<p>12&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&quot;</p>

<p>18&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 3/8&quot;</p>

<p>24&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&quot;</p>

<p>30&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 9 3/8&quot;</p>

<p>36 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 5/8&quot;</p>

<p>42&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&quot;</p>

<p>48&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6 1/2&quot;</p>

<p>54&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 5/8&quot;</p>

<p>60&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 1/2&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using a pencil connect the marks with a uniform curved line.</p>

<p>Cut out the pattern like a paper doll. You Can also cut&nbsp; a circle, hexagon or a
octagon shape about 5&quot; to 8&quot; across the flats. This will fill the hole at the
top.</p>

<p>You can actually take great liberty with the pattern development. You can create
balloon shapes of your own.</p>
