<p align="center">SYSTEMS DESIGN<br>
PROBLEM SOLVING</p>

<p>In this modular unit, you will be designing a transportation system by moving an object
using hydraulics and other energy systems. By charging the syringes and hoses with water
and constructing other devices you will be able the design a system that will work quite
nicely. First lets learn a little about hydraulics. Hydraulics is the science of
transmitting force and or motion through the medium of a confined liquid. This is, in one
way, a rather narrow scope because in its broadest sense, hydraulics encompasses any study
of fluids in motion. As such, it has it foundations from many thousands of years ago in
ancient water works and irrigation systems. The name &quot;hydraulics&quot; comes from the
Greek &quot;hydros&quot; , which means &quot;water&quot;. Just prior to the Christian era,
the mathematician Archimedes invented a device that would pump water. The Archimedes
screw, a hollow tube formed into a screw, is still in use today in Europe for drainage
systems. Near the same time as Archimedes, Hero of Alexandria actually built a turbine for
harnessing the power of a moving liquid. However, the water wheel a form of turbine,
probably dates back as much as five thousand years in China and Egypt. Yet the
transmission of power through pressure in a confined fluid has been limited to
comparatively recent times. Prior to the 15th century. When Leonardo da Vinci was the
mental giant of Europe, the very concept of pressure was virtually unknown. The study of
hydraulics was limited to the principles of flow. Even da Vinci, though he suggested
several designs for hydraulic machinery, failed to develop a clear understanding of
pressure. More than a hundred years later, the Italian Evangelista Torrecelli observed the
principle of the mercury barometer and related it to the weight of the atmosphere.
Building upon Torricelli's findings, the French scientist Blaise Pascal discovered the
principle of hydraulic leverage known as Pascals Law. It is from this law that the entire
science of pressure hydraulics has developed in a few hundred years. The first practical
use of pressure hydraulics was in 1795, when Joseph Bramah developed the original
hydraulic press. Using water as the hydraulic medium, and using the principle of Pascal to
achieve a huge mechanical advantage or force multiplication. Today, there are many
thousands of pressure operated machines and they are so distinct from earlier devices we
must divide hydraulics into two sciences; hydrodynamics and hydrostatics. Hydrodynamics
can be called the science of moving liquids; hydrostatics, the science of liquids under
pressure. A water wheel or turbine represents a hydrodynamic device. Energy is transmitted
by the impact of a moving fluid against blades or vanes. In other words, we are using the
kinetic energy, or energy of motion, that the liquid contains. In a hydrostatic device,
power is transmitted by pushing on a confined liquid. The liquid must move or flow to
cause motion; but the movement is incidental to the force output. A transfer of energy
takes the place because a quantity of liquid is subject to pressure. Most of the hydraulic
machines in use today operate hydrostatically; that is through pressure. Their study
should be technically be referred to as hydrostatic or pressure hydraulics. But new science
has so far &quot;dwarfed&quot; the old, that the name &quot;Hydraulics&quot; has stuck to
the new. With so many uses for fluid power; hydraulics is known as the work horse of
American Industry. In studying the basic principles of hydraulics, we will be concerned
with forces, energy transfer, work and power. We will relate these to the two fundamental
conditions or phenomena that we encounter in a hydraulic system. They are pressure and
flow. Pressure and flow, of course, must be inter-related in considering work, energy and
power. On the other hand, each has its own particular job to do.&nbsp;Pressure is
responsible for pushing or exerting a force or&nbsp;torque.&nbsp;Flow is responsible for
making something move; for causing motion. Because these jobs are often confused by the
uninitiated, try to keep them distinct as we consider separately and the together the
phenomena of pressure and flow. What is pressure? To the engineer, pressure is a term used
to define how much force is exerted against a specific area. The technical definition of
pressure, is force per unit area. We are not, however, quite ready for the technical
definition yet. Before we attempt to develop and understand it, pressure occurs. If
you
have ever tried to force a stopper into a bottle that was completely full of water, you
have experienced the near incompressibility of a liquid. If you were so bold as to hit the
stopper with a hammer, chances are you would break the bottle. Air, of course, like all
gases, is highly compressible. Pushing that same stopper into a empty bottle would be no
problem at all. This behavior of a fluid is what makes it possible to transmit a push
through pipes or hoses, around corners, up and down and so on. Pascal's Law Pressure in a
confined fluid is transmitted undiminished in every direction, and acts with equal force
on equal areas, and at right angles to the container walls. The apparatus Pascal used to
develop his law probably consisted of two cylinders of different diameters connected by a
tube or hose. With liquid trapped inside of one cylinder and liquid filled within the
tube. He might as will have called this apparatus the hydraulic lever, since it proved
that leverage can be gained hydraulically as well as mechanically. Pascal found that a
small amount of weight on a small piston will equal a large weight on a large piston. In
the system design you will be constructing, you are more interested in distances than of
weight. Lets make a simple hydraulic lever. From the tray of materials, acquire 2 3cc
syringes and connect them together with a short piece of tubing. Fill one of the syringes
with water along with the tube. Do not fill both syringes. Your apparatus should look it
this as you apply pressure to the cylinder with the plunger extended, the cylinder
with the plunger retracted will begin to move out the same distance to the plunger you are
applying pressure. There is no advantage to this hydraulic system. Replace one of the
cylinders the next size cylinder and fill it with water. Push gently on the larger
cylinder's plunger. Notice the smaller syringe will move out at a faster rate. You now
have a mechanical advantage. This advantage is proportional to the sizes of the cylinders
used. Example: If a 3cc syringe and a 6cc syringe were used, the advantage would be 2:1.
If a 9cc syringe and a 3cc syringe were used, the advantage would be 3:1.</p>

<p>BUILDING A SYSTEMS MODEL</p>

<p>OBJECTIVE: You are to construct hydraulic system to move a small cube a distance of 12
inches. This distance can be in any direction. This distance will not include the distance
the object moves by gravity or by falling.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS: Your system should be mounted on a base of some sort. Cardboard works
fine. You may use the sheets of aluminum located on the work bench. Construct your system
to a suitable size, don't over do it. Use small amounts of hot glue. You will have to take
your system apart after grading and video taping.</p>

<p>HELPFUL HINTS: Have one control &quot;teach pendent&quot; (put all your input syringes
mounted on a single piece of wood). Place this &quot;teach pendent&quot; in one location
so you will not have to be in the way of the operation of the system. Use the large
cylinders to operate the smaller cylinders. BE CAREFUL: Do not burn yourself with the hot
glue or the glue gun. Do not damage the syringes. Keep things in order for the next group
to use this module. </p>

that can be used in this module. After you have completed the first activity of
constructing a systems model, have the instructor look at it, video tape the operation of
