	<h1>Minecraft EDU Infomation</h1>
		
		<p>Minecraft EDU is based on the Bedrock version of Minecraft. It has special features, but is limited in other ways. One large issue with Mincraft Education Edition is that it is currently impossible to create
		servers you can with both Java and Bedrock editions of Minecraft. To circumvent these problems, a hosted game can be created and left online at all times to act in a server fashion. I have done that for our district
		(really anyone with a K12 address and Minecraft Education Edition license can join). Two "servers" currently exist and are limited to 40 simultaneous players. Anarchy.RichardtonTaylorK12.tk is as the title states: an
		anarchy server where ther are no rules. Survival.RichardtonTaylorK12.tk is a survival world set on Easy. No griefing, stealing or PVP is allowed at any time.</p>
	
		<ul><p>Anarchy</p>
			<li>Set on Normal Difficulty</li>
			<li>No Rules - PVP, Griefing, Stealing, Etc. is allowed. Pillage at your own risk!</li>
		</ul>
	
		<ul><p>Survival</p>
			<li>Set on Easy Difficulty</li>
			<li>No PVP, Griefing, Stealing, Etc.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>It should go without saying that all school rules in regards to conduct are to be followed per the student handbook. This also applies to the official school <a href="">Discord</a> server and <a href=""> Microsoft Teams</a> group.</p>
