	<h1>Welcome to Richardton-Taylor's IT Links Page</h1>
	<p>Inspired by 90's and early 2000's website design, it includes links to several useful items such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A link to old versions of the school website to reference how far our website and web design has come.</li>
			<li>A link to Richardton-Taylor Minecraft EDU information.</li><br>
			
    <a href="index.html">Click here for the old school website!</a><p>NOT FULLY TRANSFERRED</p><br>
	<a href="index.html">Minecraft EDU Information</a><p>SERVER NOT SPUN UP YET!</p><br>
	<p>This will eventually include a ticket system, knowledgebase, dashboards, and other neat things!</p>
